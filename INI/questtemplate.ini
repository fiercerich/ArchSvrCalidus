2	Welcome to Anchorville	The Human Village	Anchorville; Rembrandt	1		1				1			<Village Chief> Rembrandt	<Village Chief> Rembrandt				Welcome, voyager. From far across the ocean, you have come. The land in which you have set foot is Anchorville. Do you know why it is so named? This is the village founded when our tribesmen first dropped anchor on the Chantra continent. That anchor has long been the symbol of our village, and is kept safe somewhere in the village. The anchor means the world to us. Do you want to take a look? If you destroy five Green Worms for us right outside the gate, I will think about it.	Easy. Destroy five Green Worms.	Good job. You are very talented. Anchorville always welcomes a wanderer like you. I will show you the symbol of Anchorville as I promised. Wait one second.						450	Green Worm	5																																1. Destroy five Green Worms.	4	2.

There is a hole in the bottom of the box. Someone must have dug a tunnel underneath. The guard, Yuan, was patrolling the area. We'd better ask him. Ask Yuan, west of the south gate, if he saw anything.	Ask the guard, Yuan, just west of the south gate.	The chief sent you here? What? The Anchor Chest disappeared? Good Heavens! What are we going to do? This is terrible! We have to figure out what to do!																																								1.

They aren't smart enough to do that on purpose, but they instinctively dig tunnels. Whatever the cause, we need to destroy those worms and retrieve the box. Hunt the Green Worms, then find the anchor box, and take it to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village. test	The box containing the anchor is very important to us, but it might dissolve inside a Green Worm's stomach. Before that happens, catch the Green Worms, find the anchor box, and take it to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village.	What an embarrassment! You have averted a great tragedy. Losing this box would have meant the end of this village. You want me to show you the anchor now? I can't do that. The anchor box is firmly locked with a spell, no one has ever seen inside the box. What I promised to show you was just the box itself. Well, I have saved face thanks to you. Welcome again to Anchorville!			1407	Chest Containing Anchor	1	450	Green Worm		1407	Chest Containing Anchor	30	1																												1.

They sprang on me so fiercely I had to retreat without even having a chance to use my weapons. I need to heal my wounds, but the Yellow Worms bit off my bag that holds my healing potions, so I don't have any right now. I have no spare potions at home, either. I'm sorry to ask, but will you give me two Small Life Potions? I will drink one and save the other for later.	You're a traveler, so you must know how precious the potion of life is. Don't be stingy. I need two Small Life Potions. Will you generously share?	Thank you. One should do the trick for now... Finally, my bleeding has stopped and the wound is healing. Thank you so much!			190	Small Life Potion	2																																			1. Get two Small Life Potions.	11	2.

It was because of this thing. The Yellow Worm discovered it while digging in the ground. It was rolling it around like a ball. I took it with me because it seemed to be too precious to be left with a creature that does not know its worth. But I don't know anything about it either. Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village knows a lot about the village and its history, and I say we should go ask him. If you have time, deliver the relic of Anchorville to him.	Not all adventurers are good at archeology. People like me enjoy finding wealth or adventure. But things like this seem precious on the surface. So, show the Relics of Anchorville to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village.	Not all adventurers are good at archaeology. People like me enjoy finding wealth or adventure.

Are you a thief just like other people? Umm, that's why. Kauman is an adventurer but he doesn't have enough knowledge. I wonder how many people in this village would be interested in the history of Anchorville.

It's part of the funeral treasure. It was first found when we established Anchorville, but the villagers buried it when their ancestors were buried. I don't know what it was used for, but one thing is certain. We must return it to our ancestors' tomb. I am the only one who knows the location, so I should go, but I'm too weak to conquer the monsters. So, please help me. What I need you to do is destroy five Yellow Worms outside the south gate of the village and let me carry the relic out safely.	Although this may not seem like much of a quest, I can't ask a novice traveler like you to try anything larger. It would be enough if you could destroy five Yellow Worms outside the south gate of the village.	They are really violent, but I managed to succeed thanks to you. Anchorville has always valued tradition and we need to keep it that way. I hope you respect this while you stay here.						452	Yellow Worm	5																																1.

I have a quest for you. No, don't refuse.  I am grateful that you are willing to help me. Nothing big, but recently, the Magic Stone at the western sea appeared above the surface as the sand covering it was washed away, and now the Green Molds are trying to bury it. The Magic Stone protects Anchorville from sea monsters. The monsters are instictively repelled by the Magic Stone. That is why the Molds are digging at it like crazy. So, destroy five Green Molds near the Pioneer's Road. Don't be so nonchalant.	You look lazy. What are you doing? Hurry up! Just destroy five Green Molds near the Pioneer's Road.	Good job. Wasn't that a simple quest? The Magic Stone along the seashore was established by our ancestors. There are several other Magic Stones in various places.  One is the work of the famous Nathan Manas, though we don't know exactly where it is. The story says he used it when he fought over this village with Knozen, a Sea Dragon. Don't go far. I might have other quests for you.						648	Green Mold	5																																1. Destroy five Green Molds.	4	2.

A deer dug up and took away a Magic Stone, and according to the rumors, it was Nathan's Magic Stone. The defensive power of that Magic Stone protects our village so this is a dangerous situation indeed. Find and take down the Deer and retrieve Anchorville's Magic Stone. We don't know which deer took the stone, so you'll need to just defeat them until you find the right one. The deer are usually found south outside the village.	I was so focused on Green Molds that I overlooked other dangers. Oh, those monsters! We need to chain them together and throw them in the sea. Well, take down the Deer south outside the village and retrieve the Magic Stone.	Oh, this is the Magic Stone? This is the first time I've seen it in person... Well. You've done a great job.			1299	Anchorville Magic Stone	1	10	Deer		1299	Anchorville Magic Stone	30	1																												1. Take down the Deer and retrieve Anchorville's Magic Stone.	3	2.

No doubt the magician knows a lot about these kinds of things. Go to Magic Trainer Jin Tonik, west of the village. Show him this Magic Stone and tell him what happened. He will take care of it.	I don't have any interest in magic whatsoever. It's boring. So, show this Magic Stone to Magic Trainer Jin Tonik west of the village.	I was feeling a major change in the magical forces, and I realized it was because of the Magic Stone. If you don't put the Magic Stone back where it belongs, the defensive wall of the village will weaken gradually. Someone has to do something. Me? Hohoho. Is that something for an old man to do?			1299	Anchorville Magic Stone	1																																			1.

But this Magic Stone has the power of fire, so a special job is needed to seal it under the land. According to ancient records, Nathan Manas did it by making a sacrifice at the time. The sacrifice was five Deer. You must do this as well. I will carry out the ritual to rebury the Magic Stone, and you can go outside the south gate of the village and kill five Deer.	Sacrifice objects vary from time to time. Sometimes it might be a bird flying in the air, and sometimes it might be a fish jumping out of the water. In this case, the sacrifice is five Deer. I will carry out the ritual to rebury the Magic Stone, and you can go outside the south gate of the village and destroy five Deer.	Good job. I was wondering if you can also feel the protective wall regaining power. Anchorville is a village that relies on the power of its ancestors and heroes, from ancient times to the present day.

It is the day that we put Burning Eye into a long, long sleep. You wonder what Burning Eye is? It is the name of a Huge Moth that appears east of the village. Because it has great magical power, the Alchemists regard it as a great research subject. But the thing is, the Moth rises again after two years, and we thought there must be a good reason behind this phenomenon. Recently a record was found about the Burning Eye at Delfaras. I paid a huge sum to get that record, but again, the problem was that there were a lot of monsters on the way. The record will come through a land route, not a seaway. So, clear the road by destroying five Huge Moths near the Haunted Tavern.	I really want to know about the Burning Eye. So, clear the road by destroying five Huge Moths near the Haunted Tavern.

He barely escaped, but he was able to hide the record among the rocks. I think you have to go and find it. Fetch the Record of Burning Eye under the rock near the Pioneer's Path.	Things are all screwed up because of those idiots. Fetch the Record on Burning Eye from under the rock near the Pioneer's Road.	This is the record. Let's see. Oh, the seal is too tight to open.

That's what this says! One of the villagers annoyed the Wind Elemental and was about to get killed, he sacrificed his body to save his soul. He did not die, instead he was turned into a Huge Moth. Unless the Elemental allows him to change, he has to live in this form for eternity. This is far from Alchemy. Something's not right about this. We need to check it out. Go to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village who knows the history of Anchorville well.	The record is so far from what I had expected that it makes me tired. Go to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village and check this out.	The story about Burning Eye? There is definitely a story about Burning Eye. The hunting of the Burning Eye is done under my orders, because that is the only way to let the soul of Burning Eye rest for a while. Once it dies, it can rest for two years until it is reborn.

Now, don't attach much meaning to the name. I hope you can enjoy the festival as well, but I have one worry. Before we start the festival, we have a ritual of spreading Mana Potion around the village, in hopes that nothing bad will happen. But we're short on Mana Potion as some jars were broken along the way this year. I feel uncomfortable going ahead with the festival without it. So, get me three Small Mana potions.	I don't think anything catastrophic would happen just because we're missing a couple of Mana potions. But spreading the potion is also a part of our tradition, and if something bad happens without spreading the potion, I will be guilt stricken. So please get me three Small Mana Potions.	Thank you.

I have a plan to restore the building into a prosperous establishment, but in order to attract travelers, we need to find out how much evil is in the building. It's been about a year since I attached the special talisman there. The talisman carries the records of the evil spirits surrounding the place over the last year. It is about time we recover the talisman, and I believe you're the one for that quest. Please recover the Archaic Talisman attached on the Remains of the Haunted Tavern.	It may be because I like to drink, but the Haunted Tavern seems like a dream to me. It is important to me. Recover the Tattered Talisman in the Remains of the Haunted Tavern as soon as possible.

Recently, a boar we called Big Rage wandered through the village and ruined all the crops and fields. He must have been on the losing side of a fight in some other boar's territory. Well, the village has suffered greatly because of this boar, so prove yourself by defeating the Boar Big Rage southeast of the village, or on the hill east of the Haunted Tavern.	It was about a year ago your teacher came to this village, about the time Big Rage came. So he knows about Big Rage, but does he know it's still alive? Well, defeat the Boar Big Rage on the hill east of the Haunted Tavern.	Oh, you caught it! Great job! Your teacher wrote on the Letter that if you defeat Big Rage, it proves that you have met his expectations. You are indeed a superb traveler.						673	Big Rage	1																																1.

But the port they can bring their ship into is full of Maryliths. I want to oust them somehow, but no one wants to help gamblers. Villagers hate them because they might spoil the village atmosphere. If it is okay with you, I would like you to help me. You will? Thank you. Then I will tell you the first step of my 3-step Plan! Find and bring back Maryliths' Jar inside the tent of Marylith Village on the Pioneer's Road.	Don't ignore my perfect three-step Plan! Just do what I say, and bring back Maryliths' Jar from inside the tent in Marylith village on the Pioneer's Road.	Ah yes, this is it. This is Maryliths' Jar. It is not what I expected. I heard that Marylith holds this thing sacred. I don't know why because no one in this village knows much about Maryliths. Well, thank you for your efforts. What? You want to know why Marylith regard this jar so highly? I don't know.																				126091770	1540	Marylith's Jar	1																	1.

Your curiousity about that makes me curious too. Go see Adventurer Kauman at the city center and ask him about the jar.	Truthfully speaking, I'd consider selling this jar if it were valuable, but it just looks like an ordinary jar, so It's not worth it. We do need to satisfy our curiosity, though. Go to Adventurer Kauman at the city center and ask him about the jar.	What? Someone took the Maryliths' Jar? The swine. That jar is where Maryliths keep their eggs. And their chicks have deadly poison, so if you're bitten, it can be a fatal wound. I need to send someone right now and find out about it. Was it Holly, the safe keeper?																																								1. Ask Adventurer Kauman of Anchorville about the Jar.																														10	110	31	Poison and Antidote
31	Taming Marylith	Poison and Antidote	Anchorville; Kauman	1		7				1	30	Secret of the Jar	<Adventurer> Kauman	<Safe Keeper> Holly				I knew it. It looks like Maryliths are born out of the jar she brought. What are you going to do? If we don't do anything, she'll die because of the poison. Fortunately, the poison of a Young Marylith is not as deadly. We can cure her with an ordinary antidote. One Potion will be enough. Use whatever method, and get one bottle of Antidote Potion for Safe Keeper Holly, northwest of the village. Either buy it or get it from a monster	Although the poison is not deadly, if we don't do something, the nerve cells will die, and she will not be able to use her arms and legs. Are you going to leave her like that? If not, get a bottle of Antidote Potion for Safe Keeper Holly, northwest of the village! Either get it from a monster or buy it.	Thank you, you saved me. I didn't know what would be inside the jar. A chick? One was born, but I crushed it when it bit me. Even when I think of it now, it hurts. By the way, what should I do? I heard the Maryliths are really angry. I guess I should not go to the seaside for a while. By the way, what happened to my friends? I need to find out.			191	Antidote Potion	1																																			1. Get one bottle of Antidote Potion.	11	2.

Because of this jar, the Maryliths are full of poison, and my friends' ship has landed. They are weak fighters because all they do is gamble. Can I ask you a favor? Please destroy fifteen Maryliths at the Pioneer's Road so my friends can run away.	If anyone gets hurt, they will resent me forever and say they will not gamble with me anymore. Then I would have nobody to rely on in this big city. So please destroy fifteen Maryliths at the Pioneer's Road.	Thanks to you, they were able to safely get away, but they sent me a fire signal that they will never come back to this village. Hrmph. This is not my fault.

And the letter carried the same message. So it's your destiny to stop the Golden Path from opening. There's not much more in the letter, but it does say we need to defeat the monsters one by one to stop those who want to open the Golden Path. One by one, hmm. This also seems to indicate a Goblin Scout Tongtong, at Scout's Land, probably has another Letter. Steal that Letter from him.	I thought the monsters were up to something. Well, it looks like the Goblin Scout Tongtong, at the Scouting Site, has a Letter. Steal that Letter from him.	Good job. Goblin Scout Tongtong was building a small village there. If we had let him be, another Goblin Base would have appeared. It's fortunate we stopped that.

The Goblin Scout Tongtong and  Marylith Switch are two totally different tribes, but according to this letter, they have formed an alliance. It is written in monsters' letters, but I learned to read it to open the Golden Gate. Indeed, your teacher was right. Well, the alliance is not good news for us. Defeat the Marylith Switch at the Pioneer's Road.	In the long run, this is for the good of Humans. Still, for the time being, defeat the Marylith Switch at the Pioneer's Road.	Good job.

All travelers are suspects, including you. There is no guarantee you're not cooperating with the Goblin Rangers. To prove yourself innocent, bring back one Goblin's Head. To get it, use your Ransacking skill on the Goblin Guards in the Goblin Valley.	If you are cooperating with the Goblin Rangers, you will not behead them. So, in order to prove yourself innocent, bring me one Goblin's Head. You can get it by using your Ransacking skills on the Goblin Guards in the Goblin Valley.	Yes, this is a Goblin's Head.

I think I  need you to do me a favor. Get to know the villagers and find out who the culprit is. Personally, I suspect Magic Trainer Gin Tonic. Someone saw him with monsters. Go to Jin Tonik west of the village, and ask him about it.	Go to the Magic Trainer Jin Tonik, who's west of the village, and ask him if he has been secretly communicating with the monsters.	Oh, I've been found out. Yes, I teamed up with the Goblin Rangers but I had no other choice. I made a bet, and I owe them 50 Gold. Pay back? I don't think it's possible.

You can pay back the money to the monsters for me. I have other villagers I can borrow money from, but I don't want to be a burden to them. Rembrandt has already suffered much because of me. You are a foreigner, so you may not believe me but take fifty Gold to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village instead of giving it to me. You can believe in him. When you give him the money, tell him about me as well.	This is really a humiliating situation. I'm so embarrassed because of a mere fifty Gold. I had bad luck. So take the fifty Gold to chief Rembrandt at the center of the village, not me, to pay it back to the monsters.	I don't feel comfortable making big decisions like this one. I have to swallow my pride by going to the monsters. I have no other choice... I will go to negotiate with the monsters.		50																																						1.

We have already decided to show our military power, so nothing will change. Defeat ten Goblin Rangers at Sunrise Beach or at Goblin Valley. Those who are terrified will surrender.	No words are needed. Defeat ten Goblin Rangers at Sunrise Beach or at the Goblin Valley.	Thanks to you, little damage was done to our village, and we earned some income.

I think he has eyes in the back of his head. He knows what we've been doing so far. Before he left this town, he found out someone had given the documents to open the Golden Path to the monsters. He went after the betrayer and wants you to find the documents. But he didn't leave any clues to where the document is, so we asked a hunter to find the location. According to the hunter, it's inside the Goblin Basin, but he's not sure where. If you destroy twenty Goblin Guards at the Goblin Basin, the hunter said he'll find the document. When you've succeeded, go to Adventurer Kauman at the center of the village.	He's prepared as well. Go to Adventurer Kauman at the center of the village after you destroy twenty Goblin Guards in the Goblin Basin.	Oh, we have totally missed the point. Did you do what the chief asked? Your hunting skills were not that bad, but your efforts were in vain. Do not give up? What are you talking about? Giving up is not in Adventurer Kauman's vocabulary. Wait a moment.

Rockpick, a Young Redspine Wolf, lives on Sunrise Beach. What I got right was it is the Goblins that received the suspicious document. But the document was moved to where Rockpick lives under the Goblin Chief's order. Rockpick is being raised by the Goblin Chief. The monsters played it smart, but they cannot evade my information network. The document to open the Gold Road you are looking for is in the rocks of Sunrise Beach. Find the document and take it to Chief Rembrandt in the center of the village.	If you don't hurry, the monsters may find it. Then you'll have to double your efforts. Find the document to open the Golden Path at the rock of Sunrise Beach and take it to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village.	This is the document to open the Golden Path! But I can't read it. This is neither an ancient language nor an Elemental language. Although I can't truly read it, I can understand a little. But, what language do the monsters know? Could it be the Language of Darkness that is no longer used these days? It's interesting yet makes me uneasy. I will keep this for the time being until we find a solution.

Well, that's why, I don't have an answer I can give to the chief. If it is okay with you, could you give the answer to the chief?

When Delfaras was being built, our tribe sealed the place once again, keeping our promise with the Sea People. Recently, I heard something strange from Pilgram Nox who is studying there. Go to Nox.	He does not guard that place but he has been managing it for a long time. He is also a good friend of my father's. Well, go to Pilgrim Nox at the Jamushi's Seal.	Oh, you are the one with the Contract Symbol. The Mayor has an eye for assessing someone's worth. Take a break and listen to what I say.																																								1.

This happened after a Young Lycanto named Rojin appeared. Rojin is clearly different from other Young Lycantos. He has a strong and clear goal. Well, destroying Jamushi's Seal will not be an easy quest, but it is indeed troubling me. Defeat ten Young Lycantos east of Jamushi's Seal.	It's no use talking a lot. We must drive them away by defeating ten Young Lycantos east of the Jamushi's Seal.	They all ran off in chaos! You did a better job than we expected. Great work! But don't go yet.

We need to ask for repair at Delfaras, but we have to make one thing clear. It doesn't make sense to repair Jamushi's Seal with Delfaras' budget when it is the Young Lycantos that destroyed the place. I have a good idea. I know where Young Lycanto Rojin hid his money. I heard he received a money pouch with a thousand Gold and hid it. I think it's okay for us to use that money. Steal the Thousand Gold Pouch under the rock near Triangle Village.	Regardless of the reason, stealing is not good, so I would pay for the cost if I could. For a random wanderer a day's pay would be enough. However, I do not have enough money. So, steal the Gold Pouch under the rock near Triangle Village.	Good job! Lycanto have their own culture, so they need money too. It's not strange for them to keep money, but there are rumors that someone gave them that money for a specific purpose. Perhaps the money paid for the attack on Jamushi's Seal. Well, we need to take some things to Delfaras including this money, so hold on a second.																				132711129	1195	1000 Gold Pouch	1																	1.

There are signs the Young Lycantos who lost their money pouch are heading this way. In particular, this time, their Leader Rojin is coordinating the attack. He's very cunning. I cannot stay here any longer. This may become a bigger problem later on, so let's root out this issue now. Go east of the Jamushi's Seal and defeat the Young Lycanto Rojin.	Rojin clearly has different powers than other Young Lycantos. We need to be extremely careful. Go east of the Jamushi's Seal and defeat Young Lycanto Rojin.	It is said Pilgrims shouldn't kill, but there are things more important than mere words. I hope that there will be peace in the Jamushi's Seal for the time being. Great job!						685	Rojin	1																																1. Defeat the Young Lycanto Rojin east of Jamushi's Seal.	4	2.

A few days ago I was talking to Mathematician Centergoras and he said if I see someone like you, send that person to him. You definitely match his description. Centergoras told me you will be my partner in a small adventure. I had high expectations, but you look too young. Oh, I take it back. I'm sorry! Anyway, go to Mathematician Centergoras southwest of the city.	He showed great interest in you, so he must be eager to meet you. Go to the Mathematician Centergoras southwest of the city.	You're the one I was waiting for. To be more clear, your teacher was waiting for you. Haha. Your teacher and I are old friends. We've known each other since we began training.

While I was here, I searched for one thing - Zian's Proof. I've never seen it, but it was something Zian Manas created before he died. Your teacher should have given it to me, but instead he buried the Proof here for you to find. Start with the Torn Map under the rock near Triangle Village, and take it to Guard Commander Marco in front of the east gate of the city. He will be your companion for this short journey.	The map will probably show where Zian's Proof is. I don't know anything more specific than that. So, find the Torn Map under the rock near Triangle Village, and take it to Guard Commander Marco in front of the east gate of the city.	Are you back? Is Centergoras well? What is this map? Let me see. Hmm, interesting. Because of the torn part, I can't see it all, but there are all sorts of symbols. For military purposes, I take great interest in maps, so things like this really interest me. I don't know what Nox meant, but it seems you've been given a grand quest. Good. I'll help you.

He's from a minor tribe, and I have known him for ages, but this time he seems to be really angry. Would you go check on him? That's miner Pickin Firepick at the Gnomes' Cave.	I'm not totally sure, but it seems when the tribe's reputation has been hurt or insulted the Gnomes get very angry. Don't you think it's  something like that?

So please take down eight Lizardmen Fighters for my revenge. You can find them in the entrance of the mine.	Don't worry about anything else right now.

First of all, we need to find the King's treasure, defeat the Fire Lycantos and bring back King Miriman's Treasure. The Lycantos are probably near Triangle Village.	Of course, we should take responsibility for being so foolish, but it's more urgent to find the treasure. Defeat the Fire Lycantos near Triangle Village and bring back King Miriman's Treasure.

They must have hidden it somewhere deep. Still, they are stupid monsters. I can guess where they have hidden the treasure. Retrieve the Sacred Sacrifice from under the rock near Triangle Village.	I think the Sacred Sacrifice is totally useless to Fire Lycantos, so it may seem strange to them that we are eager to find it.

Another village linked to Zian. I see hope. Come with me. You are not used to the geography of this place, so I will search the village.

The coach was destroyed and most of the soldiers were killed. But most of the Lizardmen Soldiers also died and the rest escaped. We were able to evacuate what was left of our soldiers to the cave, but the Gold Nugget Chest was left at the seashore. The soldiers hid it there so it wouldn't be stolen.

Gypsy Town is along the seashore. I'm seeing a grain of hope. Go to Fortune Teller Estra at Gypsy Town.	Commander Marco sent you here. I heard you're looking for Zian's Proof. I first heard about it from my grandmother. Zian's Proof was prepared by Zian Manas in the event of his death. Zian lived alone, and did not have any descendants.

This is because Zian Manas stayed in this Gypsy Village for about six months. He might have hidden the Proof at that time. And the Lizardmen regard that Proof as sacred. This may not make sense to you, but it is nevertheless true. They are guarding a treasure. The problem is where it's hidden... we don't have a map. We need to find it from a story my grandmother vaguely told me about long ago. You don't know this place well, so I'll check the location first.

He won't let you down.	You have disturbed my valuable experiment. You're very brazen. Why are you here? Hmm... this talisman exudes evil, the power of the Earth.  Where did you find this? Is that right? This is interesting. How does anyone dare use this talisman at Limelight? I take this as a challenge against me, the great Jeriad. I will take the challenge. Give me a minute, and I will analyze the talisman thoroughly.			1440	Evil Talisman	1																																			1.

That's why it's more difficult to solve. The Alchemy used in this talisman is different from that used these days. But who am I? I am Alchemist Jeriad! I can do whatever I want. I know everything about this primitive magic. Do you know the traits of primitive magic? It uses raw materials gained easily in everyday life. We need those raw materials to decrypt this talisman. You, go get two Cave Mushrooms. You can buy them from the cook. The Cave Mushrooms pull away the power of the Earth, so it can lessen the power in this talisman.	It is an error to disregard the power of alchemy, but it is wrong to overestimate its power as well. After all, it's belief that determines one's power. It does not matter what raw material we use. Get two Cave Mushrooms. You can buy them from the cook.	Did you bring them? You've done a great job. It may have been difficult, but it should be a rewarding experience. Exactly two, right? I was worried you might eat them on your way back. These mushrooms taste great. Well, wait a moment.			638	Cave Mushroom	2																																			1.

The power of the Cave Mushrooms, aren't they great? As you can see, it purifies the talisman and brings positive power. Now, put the purified talisman back where it belongs, and a positive change will occur. It will purify the contaminated air once polluted by the talisman. This means someone has to go there. I will risk my life to put the talisman back to where it belongs, and you can destroy twelve Young Torges in the Silent Forest so they will not bother me while I'm doing my job. That is enough for you.	Are you planning to destroy somebody? Go to the Silent Forrest and defeat twelve Young Torgess. Otherwise, I cannot carry out my work.	Will it work?

She is Craftsman Givinia, southwest of the city. She is a bit cold hearted, but has great skills, so she may give us the answer we're looking for. Go to Craftsman Givinia.	She is bold, so it's better to be careful.  Go to Craftsman Givinia southwest of the city.	It's you. The one who left me that strange gem and never appeared. Commander Marco told me about you. I hate people like you that have no plans whatsoever. I'm busy. I have a hard enough time doing my work, and now you're bothering me. Nevertheless, it is an interesting story.

At first sight, it looks like one jewel, but this is a sophisticated piece of work. The outside and inside are separated by a very thin layer. I want to meet the person who has such superb skills. Well. In order to know what's written on it, we need to grind this side of the Jewel, but metal tools will only break it. The best way is to grind it with another jewel named the Earth's Eye. This jewel forms when the power of the Earth Elemental crystalizes. It's different from the Elemental Stone. No one knows how it came into being. On the outside, it's glossy, but it's opaque and has a rough surface if you split it right. It's the best tool for delicate work because it doesn't wear away. The Earth's Eyes are usually found under the rocks near Anchorville. Find an Earth's Eye under a rock and bring it back to me.	Don't forget, we can't do anything without the Earth's Eye. Find an Earth's Eye under a rock near Anchorville and bring it back.	You have brought back a good Earth's Eye. Thanks.

In order to clean the jewel without scratches, I need to go to the Miracle Spring. Not just anyone can clean the jewel. Only Craftsmen with sophisticated skills can do it. The monsters on the way may make it difficult. So defeat eight Magic Lykantos near Triangle Village. Don't come back to me, but go to Commander Marco in front of the east gate of the city. I will give this Jewel to him.	You are really bothersome. Must I say it twice? You must be dumb. Defeat eight Magic Lykantos near Triangle Village, then go to Commander Marco in front of the east gate of the city.	Back so soon? Just a while ago, Givinia came and gave me the Jewel. I can see it clearly now. It says, I am here at the place that purifies the region. If I am right, that place is the Miracle Fountain. Does that mean it's hidden deep in the Miracle Fountain? But I haven't heard anything about it.  Hiding something inside the Miracle Fountain? Hmm, I need to look into this issue.

Lizardman Warrior Ingo is attacking those crossing the bridge along the seashore and stealing all their goods. What's scarier is he has a Ring of Control, and he can control the people he attacks. It has already happened several times, and my friend has been attacked this time. If we can't destroy the Ring of Control, this tragedy will continue. In order to put an end to this problem, Alchemist Jeriad said he needs someone to help him. Go to Jeriad south of the city plaza.	Jeriad does not make hollow promises.

I don't know how Ingo got it, but that's not important. In order to make the ring visible, we need to use the secret potion passed on in Alchemy books. To make that secret potion, we need to go to a particular place to collect raw materials, but there are lots of Silver Lycantos there now. I'm an alchemist, not a fighter. I need someone to keep those Lycantos away. I heard you're powerful though, so defeat six Silver Lycantos in front of the King's Bridge. I will collect raw materials in the meantime.	You can't understand me? If you cannot defeat six Silver Lycantos, I may die. Go to the King's Bridge and complete your quest right away.	I managed to get the raw materials, but I'm hurt.

Here, I'll put the magical potion on your weapon. Now go to the Rebinile River entrance, defeat the Lizardman Warrior Ingo, and get me the Ring of Control.	I don't need anything else. Quick! Go to the mouth of Rabinile River, defeat Lizardman Warrior Ingo, and get me his Ring of Control!	Is this the Ring of Control? I can see the evil spirit power of ancient times.

Northwest of this city is a Blue Woman Statue, and in the statue there is a Magic Stone that cures everything. Get me that stone. Only this will cure me!	If you take too much time, the same evil thing will happen again. I'll want to control everybody with this Ring. So, get me the Woman Statue's Magic Stone, northwest of the city.	I didn't know the Ring of Control was this evil and horrifying. At first, I wanted to study it, but this experience has taught me not to.

96	Zian's Proof	The Secret of Miracle Fountain	Delfaras; Marco	3		15				1	90	Truth of Jewel	<Guard Commander> Marco	<Pilgrim> Canaria				As I went through the records, I found that Zian Manas came to the Miracle Spring frequently. According to the records, he toured Limelight in his later years, and he went to Gypsy Town after coming to the Miracle Spring, then crossed the bridge to return to Tullan. I think there is a high possibility that my assumption is right. There is also a place in the Miracle Spring that holds a separate record. I think it is better to go there. Go to the Miracle Spring and ask Pilgrim Canaria.	Moreover, there are rumors that something bad is happening near the Miracle Fountain, so go and check it out. Go to the Miracle Spring and ask Pilgrim Canaria about it.	You have come from Delfaras. I was waiting for you. How did I know? the Miracle Spring is loved by the Water Elemental. The Water Elemental told me that you would come. I know why you came as well. Please gather your thoughts and concentrate.																																								1.

The Water Elemental told me that as well. The Proof you're looking for is in the Fountain, but you don't know why Zian's Proof is so significant. This Proof is the line between Good and Evil. Zian got it after fighting Black Mine Bultak at Black Mountain. Zian Manas wanted to destroy that Proof, but he had to leave that responsibility to following generations. He buried the Proof here in Miracle Spring, and hoped somebody would find it and destroy it. Yes, you have that opportunity. But before you find the Proof, you have to go through a test created by Zian Manas. Defeat the Young Torge Gasios at Silent Forest.	Gasios is the envoy of the Elementals Zian sent through a magician. Gasios guards the place and tests people who come for the Proof. You must defeat Young Torge Gasios in Silent Forest.	You have defeated Gasios. You have certainly passed Zian's test. Close your eyes and rest a while. Zian's Proof will appear before you.						61	Gasios	1																																1. Defeat the Young Torge Gasios at Silent Forest.	4	2.

It's now your quest to destroy the Proof. I don't know how. It's your quest to find out. Be careful about one thing. According to the last chapter of the records Zian left in the Fountain, The day the Proof is destroyed, the God of Death will appear again. That will be the last ordeal. Remember what I said. Take Zian's Proof to Commander Marco in front of the east gate of Delfaras Castle. He can help.	You can't solve this problem by yourself. The answer can be found in the magical city of Delfaras. Take the Zian's Proof to Commander Marco in front of the east gate of Delfaras Castle.	Is this Zian's Proof? Umm, Zian left those words? I have lived here for a long time, but I didn't know the story behind all this. I think heroes are quite different from us in their abilities. As Canaria said, this city is a magician's city. Don't worry, we're ready to do anything. While you take a break, I'll search the city and find out about the Proof. Great job.			1672	Zian's Proof	1																																			1.

All the merchants have to give them a cut every week - the best of the items coming into their shops. But I'm in trouble. I was planning to give some spices to Caravan Goldilocks, but water leaked into the warehouse and ruined my stock of seasonings.  I already told him that would be his share and if I don't honor my word, I'll be in deep trouble. So I'm asking you to get some more for me. I planned on giving Goldilocks one bottle of Spicy Seasoning. You can probably buy it from the cook.	This week is almost over, so if you're late, I'll get into serious trouble. You have no idea how terrified I am. We need one bottle of Spicy Seasoning. Use whatever means necessary to get it.	You barely made it. Phew, I am so relieved.

I'm so relieved! By the way, what I wanted to talk to you about was the person responsible for this situation. I wasn't the one who ruined it! Sydney, the merchant at Triangle Village did. She borrowed the Seasoning from me and lost it! Even though you brought it to me, I will make her repay me for it. Go to Merchant Sydney at Triangle Village and ask her for compensation.	Triangle Village is not in Delfaras, so the merchants there will not be worried. For instance, Sydney is completely at ease even though she lost the Seasoning. So, go to Merchant Sydney in Triangle Village and ask her for compensation.	I knew Bleth would someday send someone about the Seasoning. It's just that I really needed it and I couldn't get it from anywhere else....I think I dropped it in front of the King's Bridge. Oh, what's that? She wants some kind of compensation? What would replace Seasoning? Wait a minute.																																								1. Go to Merchant Sydney in Triangle Village.																														170	1090	102	The Pirate King's Treasure

I heard about it while I was traveling. A precious treasure is buried under Scouting Site in Goblin Scout's Village. It's a Wine Bottle the famous Pirate King Tarrosa found deep in the sea. He carved his signature on it so that no one would steal it. It is really precious and valuable. At the moment, Goblin Scouts are guarding the Wine Bottle, and I believe you can steal it with your power. Find the Engraved Wine Bottle in Goblin Scout's Village in the Scouting Site and give it to Merchant Bleth west of Delfaras Plaza.	Find the Engraved Wine Bottle in the Goblin camp at the Scouting Site and give it to the Merchant Bleth, who's west of Delfaras Plaza.	There's another treasure besides the Prayer Stone? Pirate King Tarrosa's treasure? That interests me. Let me see....This is not Pirate King Tarrosa's treasure! This is just an ordinary wine bottle with Sydney's signature on it.

Well, let's see how she responds when we attack this farm! Defeat ten Blue Cubes south of the Warrior's Bridge and then go to Merchant Sydney in Triangle Village. She will be dumbfounded!	A woman as arrogant as her should be taught a lesson. Defeat ten Blue Cubes south of the Warrior's Bridge and then go to Merchant Sydney in Triangle Village.	What in the world are you doing!?

But the task I give you is totally dependant upon your ability. Marylith Liquid can be found across the river and have a lot of valuable things, like gems.  Bleth always likes expensive things. Just recently, Maryliths killed some noblemen from Tullan and stole a very precious gem called the Jewel of Darkness. I haven't seen it yet, but one thing is for sure, we'll find it! Destroy Marylith Liquids at the Warrior Plains and get the Jewel of Darkness. If you succeed, give it to Merchant Bleth, west of Delfaras Plaza, and tell him this is it.	I don't feel comfortable doing this, but Delfaras and Tullan are two totally different cities, aren't they? Bleth will decide whether to sell it or give it to someone else. So, destroy some Marylith Liquids in the Warrior Plains and then get the Jewel of Darkness. If you succeed, give it to Merchant Bleth west of Delfaras Plaza.	Oh, this is the Jewel of Darkness! Of course, I've heard about it. I heard it was lost in Tullan and that it's worth untold sums of Gold. Famous gems are hard to sell, but I'll be able to get a fortune for this one!

The proof Bultac has in Black Mountain was a bridge linking the present world with the underworld. As long as you have Zian's Proof, you can move from the world of the dead to that of the living, and vise versa. It is thus the most powerful object on earth! Zian's Proof can only be destroyed by the dead.  You and I aren't  dead, so we can't do anything. However, I did ask the knowledgeable Adventurer Iva what he thinks. Maybe he found out something.  Go to Adventurer Iva southwest of the city.	Iva has been on many adventures, and he might be able to shed some light on this subject. Go to Adventurer Iva southwest of the city.	I heard about you from Commander Marco. I did go to Black Mountain once but I didn't know anything about what happened there a hundred years ago.  I've learned a lot searching through documents since then. How can we destroy an object that only the dead can destroy? Let's see....																																								1.

It all started when you brought back Zian's Proof. So I searched some records and found out Zian Manas was related to Delfaras' famous Mercenary Commander Victor, and after Zian retrieved the proof, Victor attacked Zian to steal it.  He ultimately failed and ended up dying with all his troops. When the Black Power of Northern Land spread across the continent, Victor was reborn as a Skeleton Commander. So this is a sign that the Vengeful Spirit reacted to the proof. While I was reading these documents, something came to mind. I have a task for you. Find the Yellow Magic Jewel among the remains of the Haunted Tavern. It will be useful.	I heard Skeletons are coming out of the Vengeful Basin. Are you going to wait for them to attack this city? Quick, find the Yellow Magic Jewel from among the remains of the Haunted Tavern.	The Yellow Magic Jewel was extracted from the skull of a corpse. It was used to erase all memories the dead had of this world and blocked them from approaching. If you have this, I think you can erase the memory of the proof as well.																				132645436	1246	Yellow Magic Jewel	1																	1.

I'll hide Zian's Proof and the Yellow Magic Jewel inside your armor. If the dead are not going to willingly destroy the proof, the only other way is to force them into destroying it. Victor is the only one with enough power to destroy the proof, so you must fight him head to head and get him to attack you. Only an able person like you can do it. Don't worry. The Chief and I have already taken care of other issues. A sufficient number of soldiers will have your back. All you have to do is go to the Vengeful Basin and defeat Skeleton Commander Victor.  As soon as you confirm Zian's Proof is destroyed, go report to Commander Marco in front of the east gate of the city.	The chief will be very happy as well. Go to the Vengeful Basin, defeat the Skeleton Commander Victor, and report the situation to Chief Marco in front of the east gate of the city.	When I first heard about the plan from Iva, I thought it was terrible. But I think he came up with it because he believes in your courage and ability. Thanks to your dedication and efforts, a dangerous object has been destroyed. I believe the reason Zian Manas passed his responsibility to destroy the object to his following generations is because he knew you would come some day.

Go to Safe Keeper Himena southeast of Delfaras Plaza, and ask why she wanted me to come.	I can't think of a reason she might be asking for me. Go to Safe Keeper Himena, just southeast of Delfaras Plaza, and ask her why she wanted me to come.	You came instead of Sydney? I didn't say to send someone else. What? She asked you to ask me why I told her to come? She is so brazen. How can she feign innocence? You don't seem to know, so I will tell you the story. A while ago, a customer said that Lizardmen Thieves stole a map from him. According to his words, the map indicated three nearby locations where treasures were buried. I happened to tell the story to Sydney, and she seemed uninterested. But this time, she caught the Lizardmen, found the map, and dug up one of the treasures. That map belonged to my customer. If she found a treasure, she should have returned it! I knew she was bold, but this is way too much. I need to think of countermeasures. She would never return the treasure nicely.																																								1. Go to the Safe Keeper Himena in Delfaras.																														210	1390	112	Explosive Document

I'll go settle this issue once and for all! I'll go see how brazen she can be when we talk face to face. But there is one worry. I told my relative I would get him Crossbow Bolts for protection, but if I go do that, Sydney might take all the treasures. So while I go to Triangle Village to meet her, can you get me a thousand Bolts? There are plenty of ways to get them.	My relative is skillful with crossbows, but if the bolts run out during his travels, it might be dangerous for him. So he needs as many bolts as he can carry. He's strong enough to carry a lot. Please get me a thousand Bolts for his safe journey.	Phew, I'm back. Are you back already? We were both fast. My hair? Oh, don't worry about it. We didn't get into a cat fight. No, we didn't.

But there are too many monsters. Neither of us can fight monsters, so I would like to ask you a favor. The treasure is hidden in the Warrior Plains. Go there and destroy ten Death Eyeballs. I just hope he will be able to finish his quest in the meantime.	Truthfully speaking, the person needing the Bolts is not my relative, but my customer. I'm sorry I had to lie to you. But I needed to keep the secret. Well, go to the Warrior Plains and destroy ten Death Eyeballs.	Good job! My customer was able to find the other two treasures after a few minor problems. I do regret giving the treasure box to Sydney, but it was the only way to get the map. It was a compromise, but thanks.

Quick, go to Miner Pickin Firepick at the Gnomes' Cave and talk to him.	Welcome. I have heard about you. I heard you can solve many things, is that right? I have high expectations. What do I need? Yes, yes, I didn't explain yet. Listen to me carefully. My ancestors made a Hundred Swords for heroes a long time ago, but as time went by, most disappeared and now only two remain. I want to retrieve those two swords before they disappear forever. That's it for now. If you have understood my story, I will continue on with the next part.																																								1.

One of the Hundred Swords was passed down in the Black Manas family. After Nathan Manas sealed Brumhart, Jian Manas used it. Another of the Hundred Swords was owned by Radeus III and given to Tullan's Martin Regen. That sword was never used. It was buried in the King's tomb, but was then stolen. The King's family managed to buy it back for a high price. But the sword is in danger of being stolen once again on its way here. The group carrying the sword is urgently asking for help. If you catch me twenty Scout Spiders near the Warriors' Plains, they will be able to escape.	It will be difficult for them to escape because of the Eyeballs in the area. If you destroy twenty Scout Spiders near the Warrior Plains, they will be able to escape.	Hmm, what can I do? The threat of the monsters means they've split up into two groups to travel. The group you helped escape didn't have the sword of Radeus III. We need to wait until the other group arrives. Good job, but we can't relax until the other group arrives, so wait a bit.						326	Scout Spider	20																																1. Destroy twenty Scout Spiders at the Warrior Plain.	4	2.

I think you are the only one fit for the quest. Find me One of the Hundred Swords between the cracks of a rock near the Land of the Lizardman's Claw.	Lizardmen thieves appear in that region. Even if they're completely stupid, they may someday find the sword and they'll make our lives miserable.

Who is the best Blacksmith in the Limelight region? It's me of course.  I'll make superb weapons and armor to show him who's the master. But I have one problem. The weapons and armor should be made of Ghoul, but I dropped the Ghoul's Fangs I'd collected into the forge, so I cannot use them anymore. Can you get me five Ghoul's Fangs?  There are no Ghouls nearby, but there are Horror Ghouls just over the bridge, north of the Old Harbor Area in Membreden. Use your Ransacking skills on them to get the fangs.	In order to win the contest, I need good materials and skill. I'm definitely more skillful than him, but if I can't get the materials, it's useless. Cross the bridge, and get me five Ghoul's Fangs by using your Ransacking skills on the Horror Ghouls north of the Old Harbor Area in Membreden.	Oh, you brought me the fangs! Great job!

Well, it doesn't bother me too much, but Adventurer Iva said he saw Blacksmith Bolpunch's Armor by accident when he was passing Triangle Village and said it was fabulous. I guess he's putting his best effort into making the armor. This doesn't mean he's better than me. I'm just curious. Just curious, and this has nothing to do with my work. So go to Blacksmith Bolpunch in Triangle Village and see his armor. I'm just curious.	I'm not asking you to do this because I accept his skills, I'm just a bit bored and curious.

Tell him I said that. Oh, one more thing I need to ask you. Paparazzi wanted to have one of my swords, but I couldn't give it to him because I lost it. Recently, though, I found out where it was. It's in the Land of Lizardman's Claw, but I don't know the exact location. If I weren't so busy, I would go search for it and give it to him. Could you do this for me? Find Bolpunch's Sword among the rocks there, and give it to Blacksmith Paparazzi west of Delfaras Plaza.	I feel bad since I should have given it to him earlier. Well, find Bolpunch's Sword among the rocks there, and give it to Blacksmith Paparazzi, just west of Delfaras Plaza.	Wow, isn't this Bolpunch's Sword?

Although the Lizardmen there are troublesome, we had no plans to continue the assault...it didn't seem urgent to put our forces in jeopardy when our military power was weakened after Usus's riot. But the noblemen made a request to the King, and the King ordered us to go on this expedition, so we have no other choice. As I said, it's difficult to conquer the area, and it's not easy for a large army to go there. The only way to satisfy the noblemen is to defeat Redsign, their chief.

He's busy searching for the Lost Armor. It's so important, all the castle villagers have been summoned to find it, including the guilds registered under him. Go to Guild Registrar Mohol in front of the east gate of the city.	He is strict and arrogant, but if you want to make your life comfortable here in the city, you need to get acquainted with him.

As you may already know, a Hard Cube has all kinds of weapons in its stomach. You can get one weapon each time you attack him. However, we don't have much time, and the guild members are complaining about the mission. I think you need to set an example for them so defeat ten Hard Cubes at Gotgot. Guild members will find the Lost Armor if you use your Ransacking skill on the Hard Cubes. That is the only way to make others follow in your footsteps....be their role model.	What you do is all for me. The credit for your destroying ten Hard Cubes belongs to me. Why? Does that seem unfair? But you gave me your word, so you need to do it. Go to Gotto and defeat ten Hard Cubes.	All of you went through a lot to find the Lost Greaves, but barely managed it. How pathetic. Well, still it's good we found what was assigned to us.

To cure them, a Healing Potion is needed, but at the moment, we don't have any. I think I need to use a natural remedy for the time being. Dried Meat is the best way to pull out the Hard Cube's secretion from their bodies. It will absorb the secretion because of its dryness. Bring me ten pieces of Dried Meat. You may buy it from a cook.	If we leave them like that they'll go crazy and I'll be blamed for that too. We don't need that, now do we?  Bring me ten pieces of Dried Meat. You can buy them from a cook. I know you can do it.	Get me that Dried Meat! Hurry, hurry! Phew, that was close. If we were even a second late, we might have been killed by the rebelling guild members. These days they're really violent.

Go to Alchemist Exerion, just west of the city plaza. Oh, he's like me. He doesn't do anything for anyone unless he gets paid for it. He's depressed at the moment because his most recent experiment failed. You must destroy Big Boar Yeti in Cape Goto before you visit him.	Isn't it natural for someone to expect compensation for a favor? I have never thought this was strange. Well, destroy Big Boar Yeti in Cape Gotto before you go to Alchemist Exerion just west of the city plaza.	I heard someone destroyed Largefoot, and I thought it would be you.  Until you came, there really haven't been any strong travelers here. Anyway, why did you defeat him? What do you need? The Talisman of Secret Observation? No wonder everyone is reluctant to talk about it. From an alchemist's point of view, the talisman is a very useful thing. If you bury the Talisman of Secret Observation under a rock or trees, it can spy on a wide area surrounding that point. In other words, no one's privacy is safe. So that's why adults, who have many sins, are so reluctant to talk about it.

Ellajean might ask for diplomatic help from Delfaras' Mayor, so we must act first. Go to Mayor Megara in the center of Delfaras Plaza and ask for help.	Elajins should not know anything at the moment.

Even when my father was alive our city had nothing to do with Elajin. Of course, we engaged in trade, but nothing more than that. This doesn't mean we were against Tullan.

Magicians and alchemists the world over thought it was possible without the Archons. I can't help but want to see it happen. For the magic I'm considering using, I need a thing called Flower of Curses. This is a flower growing where a hate-filled monster is buried. If I don't control the flower properly, there could be great trouble but since I am a superb mage I am planning to change the power of hatred into the power of magic. Well, even if I explain it to you in detail, you won't be able to understand. Just go and get it for me. Get the Flower of Curses from the cracks of the rock near the Warriors' Plains.	Are you afraid because I am asking you to get that fearful flower? Don't worry. The flower curses only those who touch its leaves. Just be careful and don't touch the leaves.

For example, there is a tree around Nocturn Yard that produces something called Life Sap. Life Sap is a miracle liquid, and if you use it while saying a sincere prayer to the Elementals, it can resuscitate dying patients.  It also brings all kinds of luck. Soldiers are ordered to collect the Life Sap every year in the city, but we can only get very small amounts every time. The River Goblin Warriors kill soldiers who come from to the city so I would like to ask you to help them. The place is near Nocturn Yard. You should first destroy ten River Goblin Warriors and then help out the soldiers collect the Life Sap.	The soldiers guarding the city are also engaged in voluntary work for the welfare of the villagers. Life Sap is not for our soldiers to use. You would be helping the whole village! Destroy ten River Goblin Warriors near Nocturn Yard.	Good job! Now all we have to do is wait for the soldiers to bring back the Life Sap.

We were able to collect Life Sap, but because of our carelessness, it became contaminated. Perhaps poison got in the sap. Even if it's not poison, the sap smells different from previous years and the color is opaque. However, we can't go collect it again. Life Sap can be extracted from the tree only once a year. According to the Alchemist, the Miracle Spring Water can purify the Sap. I need you to get one bottle of the Miracle Spring Water from Pilgrim Canaria at Miracle Spring. Not many people know the geography of that area, so I think it is better for a traveler like you to go there.	There are a few ways the sap can get contaminated. For example, if the carrier of the sap has bad intentions in his mind, or when a person with a sin touches the sap, and so on. In fact, I don't know what each soldier is up to, so there is no way to find out what happened. In the end, it's my fault because I didn't manage the soldiers properly. Please get one bottle of Miracle Spring Water from Pilgrim Canaria at Miracle Spring.	The Life Sap produced in Tullan is not for Humans. It's comes from deep within the earth to the Wind Elemental through a tree. All under the promise between the Water Elemental and the Earth Elemental. The sap can become contaminated with just a single thought of bad intentions, so you can't purify the Life Sap here with the Miracle Spring Water because it only contains the power of the Water Elemental. Don't be disappointed though. You have many other options. Wait a minute.																																								1.

Say thank you to Archer Armor Merchant Noviel southeast of the city, but I can't accept it. A Human-style birthday? Who would have thought?	She is very curios about the Human way of life, so I guess she wanted to try something new. Well, take this back to Archer Armor Merchant Noviel southeast of the city, and tell her that I thank her for the thought, but I can't accept it.	Oh, why did you bring this back? Oh, right, it wasn't a Marylith Jar she wanted. I am so absent-minded. If I had given this to Ermelen, someone else would be upset. I need to think for a while to remember what she wanted.

She really wanted the Talisman of Trees the Torge have. Why didn't I remember it earlier? If you have the Talisman of Trees, you can conceal yourself in dark places. That's why she wanted it, but I think this quest is quite difficult. You will get it for me? Thank you so much. Find the Talisman of Trees by defeating the Torges near Nocturn Yard. Then take it to Archer Weapons Merchant Ermelen southeast of the city.	I made a mistake, and I can only make up for it if you hurry. Find the Talisman of Trees by defeating the Rock Torges near Knockturn Yard. Then take it to Archer Weapons Merchant Ermelen southeast of the city.	I hate to break it to my sister, but I never wanted the Talisman of Trees in the first place. However, I would feel bad telling her she made another mistake. I will just take it.

The struggles have been about conquering the fertile lands of Tullan. The biggest war was the war against Elajins, and the Hundred Day War between Zian and Ugdrasil a century ago. But young men in the castle will remember when Usus attacked a year ago. The alliance between Humans and Orcs are now chasing Usus under an agreement they signed half a year ago. But they've yet to see any fruitful results. It's not easy to distinguish truth from rumors brought in by travelers. Adventurer Lariat, east inside the city, knows a lot more about this kind of news. Go ask him if he's heard any news recently.	When we were attacked by Usus a year ago, the villagers were overly dependent on rumors for their news. But we should't give too much credence to all these stories floating around.

Go and ask him whether he has received any real news.	I hear useless rumors, but today I heard something I would like to share with you. Will you tell me your name? Don't be suspicious.

Although the plan was not implemented, he also had a plan to use the power of fallen soldiers from a century ago. To implement the plan, Usus brought back something called the Undead's Symbol, a source of enormous power using the essence of wandering souls. But for some reason, he didn't use the Symbol and didn't take it back with him when he left Tullan. In other words, that Symbol is hidden somewhere in Tullan. So I will look into this information, and I need your help. It would be of much help to me if you could get me a Wolf Metamorphosis Potion. You can get it by using alchemy or through other means.

But, unfortunately, I left tracks for them to follow. If we don't cover up the tracks, the Zombie Leaders will follow it and attack the city in no time. You should know there's a simple way to scatter Zombies. It doesn't matter how many enemies there are, but you should try defeating seven Zombie Leaders at the Shadow Grave. The number seven has magical power, so it can counteract the power of the Undead, although this method only lasts a limited time. It's one of our basic survival tactics.	Although it's for my own survival, please defeat seven Zombie Leaders at the Shadow Grave. I must have all seven, no less.	That was a close call. Thanks to you, I'm safe.

The Symbol was hidden for such a long time, so I can't see it unless I disperse all the curses wrapped around the Symbol. So we need to wait until the right time. Oh, you want to know why I asked you your name? A traveler from the East said he heard of the Undead's Symbol from your teacher. The traveler conveyed the message and said to engage you in the quest when you arrived at Tullan. So I just did my job. Do you understand now?

Martin Regen, founder of the city, made many charms so that the Undead would not appear near the city. Although he accepted the existence of monsters, he thought the Undead didn't belong in Tullan since they were wandering between life and death. Recently, however, they appear frequently. I'm afraid this means they gained more power than Regen's charms can ward off. Collect information from villagers to help us verify the situation. Guard Arian always guards the plains, so he must know something about this. He's patrolling the south gate of the city.	Ask Guard Arian in front of the south gate of the city about the appearance of the Undead around the area.	The Undead? I had many ideas, but I couldn't find any answers. And I still have no answer.

Well, we need something to replace this Magic Rock. It will be best to ask Alchemist Exerion to make something for us, but he will not help us unless we give him what he wants. In the past, I lost the Sorcerer's Scroll at Knockton Yard, and I remember Exerion was eager to get it back. Find the Scroll and give it to Exerion. You will find it between the buildings at Knocton Yard. Take it to Alchemist Exerion west near the village plaza, and ask him to make us a rock.	I also want to have that Scroll, but I don't feel bad because I gave up on having it when I lost it at Knockturn Yard. So don't you worry.

The object first appeared north of Ezerock. There's a place there called the Land of Death, and there was a Sorcerer who conquered the Undead King Tangerian. The Sorcerer took Tangerian's bones, and since then, the bones have been referred to as the Undead Symbol. The person possessing the bones can summon the authority of Tangerian at anytime and control the Undead. Scary object, huh? I still wonder why Usus didn't use it. Not only me, but many others are looking for the Undead Symbol. Go to Magic Weapons Merchant Lucia southwest of the city, and listen to what she has found out. Sharing information is not a bad idea.	She's not the only one in search of the object, but for now go to Magic Weapons Merchant Lucia southwest of the city.	You're talking about the Undead Symbol.

I don't care what anyone does to fulfill one's desires, but I can't accept this city being destroyed. Evidence? I have one thing that comes to mind. I saw them hide something at Nocturn Yard. That may be sufficient evidence. I know the location, but I can't explain it to you because Nocturn Yard is too complicated. I will find the thing they hid. You go and defeat fifteen Gargoyles. Your job is to protect me.	Don't worry. I know that it's dangerous there, but I'm not so weak I'd let them eat me. If you're that worried, just help me by defeating fifteen Gargoyles at Nocturn Yard.	It was a talisman they hid at Nocturn Yard. I know very well what this talisman is. After all, I am a Magic Weapons Merchant. This is a Talisman of Magic Perpetuation. It maintains the magical power consistently within a certain range where it's attached. Then, can't that mean the Undead's Symbol is nearby? I can only think of it that way.

Who are they? They are those carrying talismans in search of the Undead's Symbol. The three of us had our homes ransacked recently. They tried to make us believe it was petty thieves' work, but we knew what they were looking for. Although they haven't done anything dangerous to us up until now, we know it will become more and more dangerous if we keep it any longer. I think it's best to take it out of the village. So we decided to create a diversion. Although Aaron has it, I will pretend that I have it. We need your help in this act. I will run away as if I am trying to hide it in Low Wind Village. But, you need to go and defeat ten Ghouls east of the Shadow Grave and return quickly.	We need to act as if this is the truth. I will run as fast as I can, so you go and defeat ten Ghouls east of the Shadow Grave and return quickly.	Phew, did it go okay? Didn't they get tricked?

It seems Aaron has failed this time, as well. They don't seem to fall for our tricks, and they might even find out where we hid the Undead Symbol. I need to think a lot.

After the job, they demanded more money than we had originally agreed on, so I refused to pay them. Since then, they've been waiting outside the castle just to get hold of me. So I put out a bounty of three thousand Gold on their heads. I even took out an official warrant. Deliver the Warrant for Red Boar Imps to Mayor Cutty, south of the central plaza, and ask him to post it throughout the city.	If I don't get through this mess, I may not be able to continue being a safe keeper. So please deliver the Warrant for the Red Boar Imps to Mayor Cutty south of the central plaza.

Guard Arian must have seen the warrant Avlin distributed and decided to take the challenge. He said he was going to start hunting and requested a favor of me - two bottles of Cool Seasoning. I'm guessing he's going to sprinkle it on some bait to lure the Red Boars, but if the Imp is riding on his back...  Anyway, hurry up and get those to Guard Arian in front of the south gate of the city.	Arian's not really a skilled guard, but he does have a strong drive for success. Deliver two bottles of Cool Seasoning to Guard Arian in front of the south gate of the city. You can buy them from a cook.	Thank you for bringing me what I need. According to my research, Red Boars love the smell of this seasoning. I'm going to lure them to a certain area and then attack. The more prepared I am, the better.

If there is one thing they really like, it's Torge Leaves. I'd like you to use your Ransacking skill on the Rock Torges near Nocturn Yard and collect ten Torge Leaves.	Why can't I hunt them myself? W-well... It's because I have no Ransacking skill.  So please use your Ransacking skill on the Rock Torges near Nocturn Yard and  get ten Torge's Leaf for me.	We're ready to go! Er, well, let me check. We've got armor. We've got weapons. Good. Okay, take a deep breath. This is nerve-racking.  I can't stop shaking.

My buddy says he scattered poisoned bait around the field to lure Red Boars, but Imps are no fools. They won't fall for that. Now that I give it some thought, this strategy is actually quite dangerous. He could ruin the whole thing for us. I'll have to step in this time. Bring back the Poisoned Boar Feed from the rocks near the Shadow Tombs.	Avlin didn't set any specific conditions, so it doesn't matter if we use poison. We just need to catch them. But we need to be careful because we could lose both our honor and our bounty. Bring back the Poisoned Boar Feed from the rocks near the Shadow Grave.	Oh, what a relief! That's good news.

After the war was over, Monk Zian Manas ordered that a moat be dug around the castle for defense purposes. That is how this moat was created. Water is delivered through a waterway from the Blue River in the east, but recently, a Silver Moth named Ding has been fiercely attacking soldiers near the bridge, which crosses this waterway. There were such diverse opinions on this matter that we put Rope in charge of the investigation. We need to give him three bottles of Large Life Potion, but I have none with me. Find some potion and give them to Adventurer Rope east of the city.	He's still investigating. He needs plenty of Life Potions or Mana Potions because he always runs into monsters when he goes out.  Deliver three bottles of Large Life Potion to Adventurer Rope east of the city.	It's a Life Potion. This task is harder than you might think. When you come into contact with Ding, just a few Life Potions won't be enough. She's very poisonous. Do you want to learn more about this task? I've done some research. Give me a second.

Since then, Ding has been looking for them and ended up getting into fights with the soldiers patrolling the city. I tried looking for them myself, but didn't have any luck. So go to Guard Arian in front of the south gate of the city and ask him if he's seen the eggs.	Well, monster eggs are still eggs, I suppose. Ding is exceptional in that we can communicate with her. So go to Guard Arian in front of the south gate of the city and ask him if he's seen the eggs.	Oh, e-eggs?  Of course, I've seen them.  Oh, I don't know if I should tell the truth...  But I will.

At times like this, I think it's best to put your mind to other things such as hunting. They say Young Dreadwolves have appeared outside the east gate of Tullan. Let's hunt them down.

He says he's going to steal a gem called the Fire Ruby. After receiving his notice, we did a lot of thinking and came up with a plan to hide the Ruby outside the castle where no one would ever look. It's a safe place, difficult to reach and unlikely to have any treasure whatsoever.  But I think Red Ribbon found out about our plan. So leaving the gem there is as good as inviting him to take it. Your job is to bring back the Ruby as quickly as you can. A traveler like you can do that without being considered suspicious. Bring back the Fire Ruby from the Ruins of Nocturn Yard.

Besides the four magic devices, two more things are needed. Posto has already obtained them and placed them in two locations according to the Magic Square. We must remove them. I asked Lucia to remove one of them and I will ask you to remove the other. Go to the Old Harbor and bring back the Incantation Letter of Chaos from under a rock.

Anyway, I need someone to watch my back while I do my job. So I must ask you to destroy fifteen Lamia Maids near the broken bridge. Meanwhile, I will restore the bridge.	Radeus III left a Record of the Royal Family between the destroyed parts of the bridge so no one would touch it. That's why the bridge can't be damaged any further.

334	Dangerous Book	Far Away Dispatch	Tullan; Beacon	1		37				1			<General> Beacon	<Elder> Mybling				We have a problem. One of the valuables from inside the palace has been stolen. It's called the 'Book of Havoc.'  It's a one-of-a-kind book that lists all the powerful magic that has been secretly researched in the palace. Last night, the Spriggans stole it. We responded swiftly and searched the headquarters of the Spriggans, but haven't found it yet.  After questioning the Spriggans, we found out that one of them went to Ellore with the book. He plans to go to the east using a portal. Entering the land of the Orcs is a very delicate matter, so we're carefully preparing a plan.  You're not one of us, but please go find the Book of Havoc. First go to Elder Mybling at the western entrance of Ellore. I've already talked to him.	We'd almost finished creating our plan and were debating who to send.  That's when you showed up. Go to Elder Mybling at the western entrance of Ellore. I've already spoken him.	General Beacon told me someone was coming to see me. You don't look old enough to join our village, but I guess you can hold your own. Your face glows and your eyes are full of life. I'm sure you'll be able to complete this task.

That's why you have to go first to Ezerock through Silancium in the eastern area. When you arrive, be careful not to wander around too much and don't cause trouble. From there, go to Trilgard, the city of Orcs, and find Mayor Prosto, at the east end of the city. Tell him the situation. It would be rude to go empty-handed, so let me tell you what to get. You'll see a tree when you go south of the King's Hunting Field. That tree covers the Earth's Eye. Find it and bring it to the Mayor of Trilgard to get his help.	Security Chief Koop, who rules over Zylok, isn't someone you can reason with. Go to Trilgard in Ezerock and find Mayor Prosto east of the city. Don't forget to take the Earth's Eye, which can be found in the roots of a tree south of the King's Hunting Field. Prosto will help you.	The Earth's Eye represents your affection for us. What brings you all the way to Trilgard? Are you here to deliver good news or bad news?  Hmm, so that's what happened.

Then find the Book of Havoc and return to the city of Tullan. General Beacon will be waiting for you north of Tullan Castle.	I'd like to ask you to stay longer and get some rest, but there are still many who don't like strangers within the castle. I just think it's best if you leave as soon as possible.

She returned not long ago. So go to Archer Armor Merchant Noviel southeast of the city and ask her the solution.	We cherish the Water Elemental, so making the Earth Elemental angry is always a possibility. That's why, for generations, we've learned various ways of appeasing the Earth Elemental. Go to Archer Armor Merchant Noviel southeast of the city and ask her for the solution.	Actually, I was the one who urged her to hunt the Forest Bucks, so I should be punished as well.

I hear he's over 120 years old and even fought in Zian and Ugdrasil's Hundred Days War. Anyway, he's respected as the city's elder for many reasons. The city puts on a big play once every year. He takes the role of the hero that saves the city and everyone else supports him. Strangers may find it a little funny, but it's very touching to the people of Tullan, who've constantly been involved in war. We need quite a few people for this play. Why don't you join us? Go to Guard Arian in front of the south gate of the city and he'll tell you your role.	The play is for one person, but it still requires a lot of work in order to maintain its fun.

So we try to help him as much as we can. We even have food for him in advance. He'll be coming to the front of the castle soon, so we must prepare the food.

We've decided to attack the carriage transferring him, but we don't know which road it's going to take. They're sending out several carriages on different roads so no one knows where the real Red Ribbon is. The only person who can get useful information is requesting a big reward in return for it.  I'd handle this if it wasn't much, but it's out of my league. If it's okay, I'd like you to take care of it. I think five hundred Gold would help a lot.	I know it's a lot of money, but it's urgent.

But the Jewel of Observation we planted on him hasn't been found yet. I think it would help us reveal this conspiracy. So I was wondering if you could help me. The nobleman's body was discovered near the tent in the middle of the King's Hunting Field. You might be able to find the Jewel of Observation around there.

The nobleman he killed managed all intelligence gathering for Tullan Castle, which means sensitive secrets may end up in the hands of those who wish us harm - including Orcs. No matter what anyone says, they were once our enemy and we must always be cautious. We'll have to handle this very prudently, not using our usual diplomatic approach, but some other way. There's a sorcerer named Mormorine in Trilgard. Go tell him our situation. Oh, don't go empty-handed. Destroy fifteen Black Werewolves in Baran Dyke Fortress and take them to him. It's a sure way to gain their respect.	What are you still doing here? It's good to be cautious, but come on. Go to Barandike Foretress and destroy fifteen Black Werewolves. Then take them to Sorcerer Mormorine in Trilgard and tell him about our situation.	The great General Beacon sent you. Excellent.

According to my research, I suspect they hid the book inside the watchtower. The location is so unusual, I'm the only one who can find it, but I can't handle the Vampires alone, so you must help me.  While I'm looking for the book inside the watchtower, destroy fifteen Vampires in the Elloham Watchtower.	The book has significant meaning to the Vampires. That's why they guard it with their life. Go to the Elloham Watchtower and destroy fifteen Vampires.	You've been tricked by the Vampires. I even heard them laughing at you. I hear Agony, the leader, has the book.

They've been improved by numerous sorcerers and have been handed down through the generations, so we don't know who first wrote the book, but we know Vampires found it first. So it's likely they know how to decode this difficult text, which would bring unimaginable power to Agony. There's only one thing you can do. Destroy the Vampire Agony at the Elloham Watchtower and bring back the Book of Death. It's the only way.	The people of Tullan own this land, not the Vampires. We have to teach them a lesson. Take down the Vampire Agony in the Elloham Watchtower and bring back the Book of Death.	So, this is the Book of Death. Just touching it stings my fingers. Good job. What will I do with it?

Of course, I'm sure Spriggans took it. His Majesty's using this opportunity to come up with a plan to occupy Redderhood. So we would like you to help.

The entire goal of this operation is to retrieve the King's Shield, so we have no choice. Oh, really? You can get the Shield back for us? Well, then I'll give you some useful information. According to the Scouts, the Spriggans have hidden the Shield in one of the tents in Redderhood.  It's so ordinary-looking that it can easily be overlooked. Go there and bring back the King's Shield.

Of course he'll use magic to get right back up again. What a waste of time. I guess Redderhood will have to be under his control for a while.

They've put a Talisman of Binding inside one of the tents in the Qualt Camp in order to help take the King's Hunting Field. This will make soldiers approaching redderhood feel heavy and eventually lock up their whole body. I ask you to steal the Talisman. A man of your skills should be able to do it.	Unless you move quickly, my men will be in trouble. Hurry up and bring the Talisman of Binding from one of the tents in the Qualt camp.	So this is it.

I understand you want to join the defenders, but they're composed of only the best Tullan soldiers, so you go with the Hunters and destroy Forest Deer and bring back ten pieces of Deer Grass. Use your Ransacking Skill to collect them.	You must work hard to deceive your opponent. Loaf around like you're doing now and the Spriggans will find out right away! So go destroy the Forest Bucks and use your Ransacking Skill to bring back ten pieces of Deer Grass from them.	You've done very well.  Now, the partisans will finish up the job.

It seems the defenders have been imprisoned within Redderrhood by the Spriggans. I don't know how, but I think they found out about our plan. Two of the partisans are my best commanders. If we send in our troops, they'll surely kill the soldiers.  We need to move with caution, which is why I must request your services again. Go to Redderhood and kill the Spriggan Lord Bouldo.  That will make his men disperse and help our defenders escape. Help us!	The Spriggans aren't very patient but they are violent. If we don't do something, the partisans will all die. Not only is each and every one of them important, but I also don't want to lose the main force of Dulan.  So go to Redderhood and take down the Spriggan Lord Bouldo.	All of Tullan is indebted to you! Thanks to you, my men came back to life. What you did was the most noble act possible for us humans and the whole of Tullan. We'll celebrate your heroic act forever.

They can be a rough bunch, but this time I certainly met my match. Not long ago, some Hobgoblins arrived asking for tattoos, so I gave them one each. Then when it didn't turn out the way they expected, they trashed the place. In order to remove the tattoos, I need to bring water from outside the castle, but they won't let me leave. Could you bring me some Clear Purified Water from between the Relics near the Seraphim Watchtower? Remember, only that water will work.	You're still here? You want to know more about the well? Hmm. It was created by my ancestors who once lived near the Elloham Watchtower. Ever since the day it was created, it's had the power to wash off anything, which is why I need it. Go near the Elloham Watchtower and get me the Clear Purified Water from the well.	You didn't bring me water from somewhere else, did you? Let's see.  Hmm, it certainly has the fresh smell of Clear Purified Water. Good job. We all need to help each other out, right? Hey, don't go, yet.

It's about my little brother. I hear he's made a lot of money recently and will be richer than I am soon. Do you think a billionaire like me will allow that? That's why I need your help. Of all his boxes in the center of the city, steal the Treasure Chest.  That'll do some big damage to his wealth. Hahaha. No, it's not stealing.

I'm a little upset about my younger brother being richer than me, but I don't want him to be tortured to death. Still, I can't return this, either.  So I've come up with an idea. We'll make it look like the Hobgoblins stole it. How? Simple! I'll take the box out to their area and then bring it back as if I found it. Sounds good, huh? Go west of Low Wind Village and destroy twenty Hobgoblins so I can make this work. I'll be counting on you!	What are you doing? Do you think my ancestors will leave you alone if I'm beaten to death by the Hobgoblins? Why am I pretending like this? Well, my younger brother has soldiers scattered all over looking for his Treasure Chest. In order to trick them, I need something powerful. A play that has life on the line. Okay? So go west of the Low Wind Village and destroy twenty Hobgoblins for me.	Oh, we almost got in big trouble! Wait. Let me catch my breath. What happened? I lost the Treasure Chest!

I can't and will not lose them! They're my entire fortune! But I can't solve his problem, either, because it's too difficult. I will have to end up using the ace up my sleeve. I need the Soul of Mathematics. With its help, I'll take the Mathematician Devil down at once! Hahaha. But in order to summon the Soul of Mathematics, we need one Falchion where the soul will descend. The weapons merchant won't sell one to me because I'm underage.

Get a Falchion and take it to Summoner Altman east of the central plaza.	Welcome. I already heard the story from the Genius. He told me you would come. Give me the Falchion.

You're taking too much time just because he's not your son. I don't like that kind of attitude. Stop standing around and go west of Delfaras Square. Deliver a Hammer of the Elementals to Blacksmith Paparazzi.	Hmm, I understand Bulcan's message.  You can go rest.			1974	Hammer of the Elementals	1																																			1.

He's a merchant, so I'm sure he'll release Dolce if you give him something valuable, and I know something he wants. There's a tomb of the ancients southwest of Tullan. There's a Broken Coffin there with an Ancient Perfume inside. I hear the perfume gives off a scent incomparable to anything in the world. I'm sure Goldilocks will like it.  Take the Perfume to Caravan Goldilocks southwest of the city.	Goldbeard is brutal to those who steal his things. Sometimes he privately executes them or sells them as slaves to foreign ships. Of course, I trust Dolce didn't steal anything, but this is our only choice since we can't prove his innocence. Find the Ancient Perfume from the Broken Coffin southwest of Tullan and deliver it to Blacksmith Goldbeard southwest of the city.	Oh, this smells amazing! It's definitely the Ancient Perfume! Where did you find it? What? You're giving it to me? But I'm a merchant, I know nothing in this world is free. Tell me what you want in return. Hmm, so you think Dolce is innocent and he should be released. I'll think about it. As a merchant, I always have to consider if something's profitable.																				139331520	2571	Ancient Perfume	1																	1.

I hear a small group of Young Gorgons live south of Tullan. Have you ever seen them? I hear they're the ones who took my Valuables Box. Go to Elloham Watchtower, destroy the Young Gorgons and retrieve my Valuables Box. That will prove Dolce's innocence.	I can't wait forever. This gift is the only reason I'm considering it. So go to Elloham Watchtower, destroy the Young Gorgons and retrieve the Valuables Box.	This is definitely mine. I guess Dolce didn't take it after all. Hmm.

As you know, they're only found in Silancium, but no one wants to go with me to hunt them. If you'll join me, I'll give you a great prize. Will you? Great! Your task will be to go over near the Dry River Plains of Silancium, the land of Orcs, and kill ten Arkaros Slaves. Let's go!	Hey, if you return this soon, I can't stay there for long.

Anyway, Usus had been watching us carefully for an opening to attack Tullan Castle and rumor has it the weapons he hid for this attack are still scattered around this area. I'm telling you this because of a problem we currently have. Young Gorgons of Silancium have shown up around here looking for those weapons Usus hid and are clashing with the weapons merchants in the village, creating a lot of trouble. I'd like you to help us. Your job is simple. Destroy twenty-five Young Gorgons south of the Elloham Watchtower and show them not to mess with us.	Members of the merchants' guilds have been complaining about this incident, but you're just being lazy. Go south of the Elloham Watchtower and destroy twenty-five Young Gorgons, unless you want us to teach you a lesson.	Good job.

If it's okay, I'd like you to get us some. Bring us ten slabs of Meat from a cook.	We'll take care of the cooking somehow. Get ten slabs of Meat from a cook.

Weapons merchants are making all sorts of speculations about the area the Young Gorgon's were in. There was one story that sounded useful. Grimlot, who was Usus's lieutenant at the time, was driven out by the soldiers and fled to Low Wind Village. Well, he didn't want to have his weapon taken by Humans, so he hid it under a rock. Doesn't that sound interesting? You could try looking for it. Find Grimlot's Mace under one of the rocks in Low Wind Village and bring it back here.	Well, it's not a legendary weapon and Orc weapons are of no use to us. But we can sell it to Orcs at a high price, so that's good. Hurry up and go to Low Wind Village to find the Grimlot's Mace under one of the rocks.	You found it easily?  Well, no one else could've done that.  We merchants certainly couldn't find it.

They certainly let us down this time. We paid a lot of money for them, but now they say they won't fight without the Bats' Tooth. They say it's a lucky symbol to them.

She might change her mind if we get a chance to show our skills again for His Majesty. I did some research and found out there's some cursed Broken Armor inside an old building northeast of the Broken Bridge. They say someone hid it there to afflict His Majesty, but we can't find it because we don't know the exact spot. Find the Cursed Broken Armor and go to Warrior Trainer Eron southwest of the city and try to find a solution. Then she'll think of returning to the palace as well.	That's cursed armor. It seems like it's hidden somewhere irrelevant, but it's there to afflict His Majesty. We must find it as soon as possible. Go to the old building northeast of the Broken Bridge and find the Broken Armor. Then take it to Warrior Trainer Aaron southwest of the city.	Hmm, what's this armor? It gives off some very strong, disturbing energy.  Hmm, is that what happened? I remember when I left the palace five years ago.

Palace Sorcerer Aras hates me and he recently set me up by giving me a task I could never complete alone. He's trying to get rid of me. There are ruins of the sorcerer Rakane's house near the gateway, northwest of Low Wind Village. Long ago he lived there alone, researching some evil sorcery. Then Nathan Manas killed him. But before he died, he hid a Wand that would open this area. No one goes near the ruins because of the negative energy around the area. But Aras ordered me in the name of His Majesty to bring him the Wand. So I need your help. Go west of Low Wind Village and destroy twenty-five Hobgoblin Leaders. Meanwhile, I'll search the remains.	I don't fear the power of magic. But since I'm not a warrior, I can't handle danger head-on. I need your help. Go west of Low Wind Village and destroy twenty-five Hobgoblin Leaders.	You're back. Oh, you're wounded! And all because of me. I'm so ashamed. Aras tricked me. He set a Magic Trap on the relics. It's a strong magic that reacts to my blood, so I can't ever approach that area, not even after I die. It's almost like falling to evil. I wonder how Aras found out. Anyway, can there be a solution?

Since we've agreed to go together, I have no choice if you keep idling around like that. I'll get in trouble with my wife. Go to Dusty Creek of Silancium and destroy fifteen Dark Wyverns with me.	Did you completely get rid of them? I don't know if I can trust you since you don't have any wounds, but tasks like these are all about trust. It would've been better for me to accompany you. Hmm.

They're plotting to overthrow society and take over Chantra. Thanks to the list, we were able to find most of them and get them to confess, but the one suspected to be the key figure says he has nothing to do with any of it. We have to be careful. He's a man of high status in the city. His servant says he has something to tell us about his master and is requesting some compensation. I think we have to give him what he wants, and I need your help. Bring me ten Goblins' Heads. You can get them from the Hobgoblins west of Low Wind Village using your Ransacking skill.	Don't you know how to get Goblins' Heads? Keep in mind it doesn't matter how you get them. I just recommend you use your Ransacking skill on the Hobgoblins west of Low Wind Village.

I can't say it's perfect information, but I think we'll be able to get his master based on this testimony. We're going to set up a little ruse. Most people don't feel comfortable in a foreign place. The man we're after is quite strong-willed, but is physically weak. I think we'll be able to take advantage of that. I've decided to go hunting with him and need some equipment. Please find three Silver Ray Bows for us.	Like I said, he's physically weak and doesn't have any hunting equipment. So find three Silver Ray Bows for us.

Take care of them so we can carry on with our talks. Go southwest of the Elloham Watchtower and destroy twenty Kobolt Throwers.	Your job is simple. Destroy twenty Marylith Nobles south of the Shadow Graves.	Heh, your hunting is scaring him. The wounded monsters are screaming and running around. Every time he hears them, his face goes pale.

Give up? I believe every Gold piece should go to its rightful owner. Those who try to eat for free must be punished.  The reason I'm so passionate about this right now is because of one recent traveler who ate and slept at my inn and then ran away without paying. I quickly chased him and was able to find out which direction he fled. I've released my hunting dogs and am pursuing him, but there's a problem. The hunting dogs may be brave enough to pass by the monsters, but I'm not. So help me and get rid of them. Go south of the Elloham Watchtower and destroy twenty-five Centaur Cavalrymen.	The hunting dogs are fast, so they may have caught up with him already, but if we don't follow along they might give up their chase.

He ended up being eaten by horrible monsters. Who? Oh, the Dreadwolves that live in the valleys south of Low Wind Village. I saw them chewing on him with my own eyes. Hmm, I feel bad for the innkeeper, but what can we do? Oh, one thing. The traveler had a necklace that looked quite expensive. I guess it's now inside one of the Dreadwolves. We should destroy them, get the Traveler's Necklace and take it to Innkeeper Badwell, northeast of the city. It should at least pay for everything the traveler ate.	I heard a Dreadwolf's stomach acid is so strong it can even dissolve a stone. So the necklace in their stomach won't be staying around for long.

Then, let me tell you what you should do. The Mobet Largewings can fly, and since I'm short, I can't attack them unless I bring them down to the ground.

Maybe it's because of everyone pursuing the Archons. The Archlord could be someone who brings confusion. Anyway, I'm deeply grateful for all the help. It's not easy helping out another tribe.

It can only be cured with magic, but I haven't found exactly how yet. After researching almost to death, I've found a way I can extend my life. It may be a temporary solution, but it's a blessing for someone who needs as many years as he can get. Of course, it doesn't matter how mentally strong you are if you're physically weak. I'm in such pain right now I can't even take a step, so I need your help. There's something called an Ancient Glass Bottle inside the trunk of a tree in Salarmis Garden. I discovered it a long time ago, but hid it there because it's so valuable. I need it now, so please find it and bring it to me.	It's funny that I forgot about it when I need it so urgently, isn't it? I agree, but what can I say? I don't know everything. Anyway, find the Ancient Glass Bottle inside the trunk of a tree in Salarmis's Garden and bring it back.	You brought it! Good job. Just looking at it makes me feel stronger, but I can't move yet, so I'll still need your help. Don't worry too much. They're all things that will probably be a piece of cake to you.																				139395262	2599	Ancient Glass Bottle	1																	1.

Any energy it takes in can't leave the bottle until it's broken. Hmm, I'm sure you've already guessed. What I need is to have this bottle filled with the energy of monsters. The souls of the dead. Please take this Ancient Glass Bottle southeast of Shump Village and destroy twenty Frost Thieves. It will collect energy from them that's as cold as ice. Then bring it back to me. Don't forget, it'll be no use hunting down the Frost Thieves if you drop the bottle along the way.	Be careful. If it breaks, everything will go up in smoke and I could die tomorrow. Take the Ancient Glass Bottle southeast of Shump Village and destroy twenty Frost Thieves.	Ugh, the cold energy from the bottle has practically frozen my entire body, but I feel a lot calmer. I must now process this energy. It's time to show my skills as an alchemist. Stay here.

It can't be tainted by too much civilization, so I can't get it from Membreden or Limelight. It must be pure underground water. There's only one place I know to find it. The village well in Village of Seethe in Syllancium. Please bring me some water from that well.	Seeing you hesitate is making me nervous. Don't try to trick me by bringing me just any kind of water. Only Pure Underground Water from the well in the Village of Seethe of Silancium is acceptable.	Let's see if you brought me the right water.  Hey, I feel refreshed! That's better. Thanks to you, I've come alive again, at least temporarily.  Now it's time for me to prepare myself to seek revenge on those who made me like this! Good job.

I've collected thousands of crafts while traveling around the world. Well, my wife found the Gold crafts I'd been hiding from her and took them from me, but I can't just sit back and take this. I'll just have to start over again. I heard a craftsman in Delfaras has some really nice Gold decor. I also heard you can get her attention if you bring her the Hammer of Handicraft. You'll need to hunt down Young Harpies in Shinewood to get this hammer. Then take it to Craftsman Givinia southwest of Delfaras.	I hear the Hammer of Handicraft used to be her master's, but was stolen by the Young Harpies. Go to Shinewood, destroy the Young Harpies and find the Hammer of Handicraft. Then take it to Craftsman Givinia southwest of Delfaras.	Oh, this is the Hammer of Handicraft! Where did you find this? Hmm, I see. Well, I've been feeling guilty every day since I lost my master's hammer. I'll grant you your request if you give it back to me.

I don't have it, but neither does anyone else. I need to ask around for details. Do me a favor while I make inquiries. Get me a Double Bow. Someone asked me to customize one.  Please.	What are you doing? You don't seem to be very loyal! If you think I'm unfair, then get me one Double Bow.	Oh, thank you. Now I just need to get it crated.

Fountain Lamias generally like Gold, so they probably took it. You know you have to help me since I can't fight, right? Hunt down the Fountain Lamias and retrieve the Necklace of the Royal Family. Then deliver it to Adventurer Rope east of Tullan.	You know, it's no use looking at me like a lost puppy.

I'm not too happy about it, since it sounds like they're trying to control our city, but His Majesty's subjects have complied. I heard the Stone and Sword Society Headquarters is on the 'Mountain of Endless Snow,' but it can't be reached by land. So the sorcerers suggest it be reached by water. The small lake north of Low Wind Village should act as the path. It's time to use that path and I guess I should tell the Low Wind Village Chief beforehand. Go to Village Chief Ariti Stillwisperer of Low Wind Village and ask for his help. Take three Bone Shields with you and he'll understand.	He and I are loyal friends, so I think a practical gift would be more effective than something big and lavish. Deliver three Bone Shields to Village Chief Aliti Stillwhisperer of Low Wind Village.	If it's Mayor Cutty's request, I'll have to comply. It's hard to find a citizen of Tullan with such a deep understanding of this village. So there's no need for a gift, but I'll accept it since we'll be able to use it to protect the village. Thank you.			269	Bone Shield	3																																			1.

Now that I think about it, they must've been after the mirror coming from Tullan. They're probably keeping an eye on you as well. If so, you're in danger. Leaving this area alive may be impossible. What about this? Take down the Frost Thieves near the southern gateway of Tullan and get ten Thieves' Daggers using your Ransacking skill.  Then bring them to Mayor Cutty south of the central plaza. This should confuse them about why you're here.	Going back and forth like that will make them suspect you! Destroy the Frost Thieves near the southern gateway of Tullan and get ten Thieves' Daggers using your Ransacking skill. Then take them to Mayor Cutty, just south of the central plaza.	What is it? Why are you so flushed? Hmm, I see. They're certainly not ordinary. We must hurry now. I'll go back to the palace and talk with my advisors. Good job. Oh, give me the Thief's Dagger.

We need to break that spell.  Fortunately, I found out how they cast it. They gave Reflexive Stone Tablets to the Hobgoblin Leaders west of Low Wind Village. Twenty of those Stone Tablets maintain the spell, so we have to find them, okay? Get all twenty of the Reflexive Stone Tablets!	There's no time to explain! Go west of Low Wind Village, destroy the Hobgoblin Leaders and bring back twenty Reflexive Stone Tablets!	Oh, you can't imagine what a heavy burden this is for me.

That's why it becomes very inconvenient for travelers when the path gets blocked. I hear there have been numerous incidents where Harpies have attacked travelers. It cannot be allowed, but we also cannot wield any sort of weapon on any life form living in our woods. That's the basic rule of Ellore.  So I must ask a favor of you. Destroy ten Harpies near the Woodcutters' Forest and bring them back here.	Harpies can fly, so they're the least affected by the forest. They're swift and snatch things in the blink of an eye. Destroy ten Harpies near Woodcutter Pass and bring them back.	Oh, good job. I often ask travelers to destroy them for me, but no one has done it as well as you have. Good job, but don't go yet.

He asked the villagers to search the forest and they found out it was taken by Bolko, who lives in the Dead Torges Forest. Torges who disrupt their society are exiled there, hence the name but a Rain Torge named Bolko, who was exiled there a few years ago, managed to gather other Torges into a kingdom of his own. Apparently he started using the Symbol of Darkness as his source of power. Those living in the forest must help others maintain order. According to the merchant, Bolko put the Symbol of Darkness under the torchlight in the Dead Arbors Forest. I'd like you to retrieve the Symbol of Darkness, please.	I know it's a difficult task, but it's worth it to keep order in the forest.  Be careful. Find the Symbol of Darkness under the torchlight in the Dead Arbors Forest.	Just looking at it makes me flinch. I think the Elementals will be angry if we leave it in this forest any longer, but it does belong to the traveler, so we'll have to keep it until he comes for it. Oh, I forgot to thank you.  But it's not over yet. Bolko's still alive.

You won't be able to chop off the roots with an ordinary axe. You'll need to get five Short Axes.	Oh, thank you. These axes will be quite useful.

Hmm, you believe the story? Yes, you believe it? Well, your eyes certainly suggest you're not lying. Let me get to the point anyway. The guilds that I highly respect say one of their members is missing. We often go searching for missing people, but the problem is that this time, it's the grandson of a Tullan nobleman. They're telling me to find traces of his disappearance somehow or other. So just pretend you're doing a good deed and help me out. Go outside to the tree southwest of the village and look for anything he might have had at the time he disappeared. For example, a bow. He was an archer, you know.	They say no one needs to be scared in Ellore, but I often go to the big city on business. So please go to the tree southwest outside the village and look for something like a bow.	Oh, you found it.

Plus, they even want to lead the search themselves. What power do we have? Well, I'm going to search with my men, but we have no weapons. You know why our people don't carry weapons, right?  It's the law of this village. So you must find us some weapons. What would be good? That's it! Even a fool can shoot a crossbow, so let's make it that. Find us five Wood Crossbows.	I'm not saying noblemen are fools, but I think it's better for them to use crossbows rather than carelessly wield swords. So find five Wood Crossbows for me.	Good job.

The nobleman gave up going into the forest, but there's still something he wants even if he can't avenge himself. He wants to find his grandson's family Ring he must've had with him.  I guess it's been handed down generation after geneartion. Where is it? Well, I didn't just lay here wasting time. I pressed the guild members and got some information. Apparently he died because of the Rain Torges. Rain Torges kill those who invade the forest. They never eat them, but they do tend to collect war trophies. What I'm saying is chances are good they have what the nobleman is looking for, got it? So go northwest out of Ellore, destroy the Rain Torges and bring back the Gleaming Ring.	What? Are you hesitating because you don't trust me? Go on. Go northwest out of Ellore, destroy the Rain Torges and bring back the Gleaming Ring.	Is this what the nobleman wanted us to find? Well, good job. No, I'm saying I trusted you. You even saved my life. I never would've made that decision. So don't worry.

Fortunately, Pharmacist Amund is quite knowledgeable about plants including Le Sidul. He's creating medicine that will make Le Sidul full of energy again,  but I forgot to give him the ingredients he asked for. I'm sorry, but please deliver them for me.

Oh, I was saying my goal in life has been to cultivate a great pupil. (mumbles) But I'm discouraged by all the fools out there.  For example, a friend sent me two pupils who were supposed to be quite bright, but they couldn't even pass the simplest of tests.  (mumbles) Still, they were sent by my friend, so I can't just let them die out there. I'm so busy right now, though, I need to ask you to help. Go South of Dragon's Inn and destroy ten Thunder Griffins. That will help one of the pupils escape. No more than ten.  That's just the right number for his skills.	Hey, do you want to see him die? And see my friend in despair?  Hurry south of the Dragon's Lair and destroy ten Thunder Griffins.	He's covered in blood, but managed to return. He must be worse than I thought. Maybe he would have returned unhurt if you had destroyed fifteen Thunder Griffins. Anyway, he's disqualified. Hrmph. Don't go yet.  I told you there were two pupils.						710	Thunder Griffin	10																																1. Destroy ten Thunder Griffins south of the Dragon's Inn.	4	2.

I have no idea where the other one is. There's always that one who won't follow instructions and wanders off. I need to find him. Oh, I told you why before. They're free to die if they want, but they are my friend's pupils after all, and I think my friend expects to get them back. I gave the boy the Document of Time and asked him to go against time. I guess I was asking too much. He's probably lost in the wrong section of time now. He went east of the village so he must be in the Prince's Hunting Field where there's a Monument of Ancient Civilization. It's relatively easy to go back in time if you pass through something like that. He probably did, so I'm sure we'll be able to find the Document of Time there. Bring it back to me! I need it to find out where he is.	Hey, If he'd taken the Document of Time, he probably wouldn't have gotten lost. I'm sure only his body traveled in time. Hmmph. Get the Document of Time from the Tombstone of Ancient Civilization in the Prince's Hunting Field.	Just as I expected. Hrmph. Wait, I need to track this document from the end. That fool.

But I don't think I can go alone. I have to make a Mirror of Alchemy and an alchemist is more fit for that job than I am.  So I asked Romiteus' help and he said he needs certain ingredients. I was wondering if you could get them for me.  Hrmph. How could you ask such an old man like me to do it?  If I were as young as you, it would be a piece of cake. Go near Lizardman's Claw in Membreathen and you'll find lots of Lizardmen Scouts. Use your Skinning skills on them and get fifteen Lizardmen's Skins. Then take them to Alchemist Romiteus southeast of the village.	Hey, what are you doing here? I already explained everything. Go near Lizardman's Claw in Membreathen and you'll find lots of Lizardman Scouts. Use your Skinning skills on them and get fifteen Lizardmen Skins. Then take them to Alchemist Romiteus southeast of the village.	You came when I was feeling very hungry. Do you have anything to eat? I can't eat Lizardmen's skin. I want meat. Oh, right. Fussy Mia sent these. They should be enough to make a Mirror of Alchemy. Let's look at the quality.			1004	Lizardman's Skin	15																																			1.

I'm too hungry now to explain what it is. Just do something for me while I finish eating. There's one more thing I need to make the Mirror of Alchemy. It's called a Timesand Pouch and you can only get it from Wild Mobets south of Grand Crimson in Sillancium. Don't ask why. We don't have time to waste. Just bring it to me.	Are you still wondering about that? Well, as I understand it, there was once an ancient civilization in Syllancium. The king there was called 'Time King' because he could freely control time. I hear he also made the Climate Map north of Syllancium. Well, the most cherished item among his treasures was the Timesand. He wanted to keep it safe at all costs, so when the kingdom fell, he attached it to the foot of a Wild Mobet and let it fly away.	I've tried this twice so far. This is the second time. Now that I've eaten, I have more energy. Let's get to work. Thank you.			2561	Timesand Pouch	1	753	Wild Mobet		2561	Timesand Pouch	100	1																												1.

The mirror's almost complete, but there's one more thing you need to do for me. When he returns after traveling back in time, he will be completely worn out or unable to move. He won't be in his normal state. You can easily guess what will happen if he's attacked by monsters that way. It's horrible just thinking about it. So I think you should arrange the place where he's to return to in advance. Meanwhile, Mia and I will move him to a safe place. You need to act beforehand. You said he disappeared at the Prince's Hunting Grounds, right? That's where Centaur Airbornes show up. Destroy ten of them for me and I'll do my job before I go have a sandwich. Then you should return to Magic Trainer Mia, just South West of the village, and see how things are going.	What are you doing? I've given Mia the mirror and the magic to bring the pupil back has already started. Get moving. Go to the Prince's Hunting Field and destroy ten Centaur Airbornes. Then go to Magic Trainer Mia southwest of the village and you're done.	Those fools are troubling lots of people, huh? Hrmph. You offered to help out, so it's okay. But Romiteus and I have to help out as well?  An elderly person like me? Hrmph. Well, I'm glad they're safe. Those two have been deemed unsuitable and are to return to my friend. Thank you.

I used to patrol Ellore, but I fell in love with the beautiful scenery and people of Ellore and ended up settling down there. Still, it doesn't change the fact that I'm still from Tullan. I recently got an order from Tullan to steal an important item from this village. How can I betray them like that? But if I disobey an order, I might pay with my life. There are quite a few Tullan spies here disguised as travelers. So I think I'll have to try to trick them. You'll help me, won't you? I know you fell in love with Ellore and Shinewood as well. First, I need to pretend I'm working. I'll make noise like I'll be going out soon. Meanwhile, get three Maces for me. I need to at least pretend that I’m doing some digging.	What are you doing? You might be suspected as a conspirator, so don't mess up. Get me three Maces!	Good. They're good quality. Too bad I won't be using them. What a shame. Right. Well, thank you.

If I don't do it right, I'm sure they'll suspect me. You need to distract them.  How? Well, I don't know... Oh, right. Hunting's the best way! You'll hunt near the area where I'm digging. I guess I should work in the Woodcutter Pass since there are Windwing Harpies there. Destroy fifteen Windwing Harpies for me.	What are you doing? Do you want us to die? Go to the Woodcutter Pass and destroy fifteen Windwing Harpys!	That's it. We're a great team. Very good.  That's the way to do it.

Like I said, Tullan wants me to bring back a certain item. The treasure of Ellore! But they don't know what it is. Of course, I don't, either. Anyway, I need to give them something and I was trying to think of what would work. Then a great idea suddenly came to mind. There's a tree in the lower part of Salarmis Garden. I saw some kind of document between the branches. I don't know who hid it there, but I think it's been there for quite a long time. Bring me that document. The content? Who cares? Neither the people of Tullan nor we know what the real treasure of Ellore is. Got it?	What are you worried about? You want to know about the document? I don't know what it is, but I'm sure it's not as important as Ellore's treasure. Come on, we're talking about something no one has any idea about, but your job is simple. Go to the lower part of Salarmis Garden and bring back the Document.	So? Doesn't this book look important? I'll just say it's the treasure.  Hmm. You're worried it might be full of scribbles? Oh, I don't know. Let's just go with our plan! A soldier can't be afraid of such things! Thank you!																				139395197	2605	Unknown Document	1																	1.

A few days ago, I heard a rumor that a traveler found a staff that has great magic power at the site in Woodcutter Pass. When Lingdin heard this, she said it was probably her ancestors' staff. I was supposed to deliver it to her, but I could not even go near the object because of its strong magic power. This is why I'd like to ask a favor of you. Please go and find the staff at the site and deliver it to Archer weapon merchant Lingdin in the Northwest of the village.	Rumors of a staff with great magic power have existed for a long time.

If she uses that in the contest, then it'll be highly unlikely that I'll win! Well, I did have my chances. There was this time when a wandering merchant was selling the legendary cooking utensil in this village, but he was asking too much for it and I simply could not afford his price. Now I have more money, I think I will need to get that utensil. So I'd like to ask you a favor. Can you please go and find that wandering merchant and tell him to sell me that legendary cooking equipment? Who is he? Hehe.. I'm really glad you asked that question! You are definitely interested right? He's Peddler Keep Goathead who is from South Trilgard which is in the Orc lands. Take the 2 Water Necklaces that he wanted in exchange for the item. Ok?	There must be many others who would want such a fine cooking utensil. So Please hurry! Take 2 Water Necklaces to the Peddler Keep Goathead who is in Southern Trilgard.	Eh? What? Do you have anything to say to me? Ah... I remember. Yes I do remember. How can I forget that lady who was looking at me with such sad eyes? Yes, I do have the cooking utensil. But, I need more than 2 necklaces, the market conditions have changed. Also, I've just lost everything to a monster that I met in the desert, so I'm completely broke at the moment.

Personally, I don't care what people do in the desert, but I have no choice since the village chief is all worried. So I ordered one of my men to bring back some evidence from the site of explosion. Unfortunately, he was eaten by a monster on his way back. Not only am I disturbed because I lost one of my men, but also because I lost the evidence.  You must bring it here to me.

I personally don't care about the politics, but I need to finish what I started. It seems the people of Elajins are developing a new weapon to attack Tullan. I think you should ask Gyslot to confirm that fact. He's from Elajins, so he probably has connections. Go to Traveler Gyslot, east of the village, and ask him about this incident.	It's a sensitive issue, so don't force him to talk. Go to Traveler Gyslot east of the village and ask him about the incident.	Hey, what's this? You suddenly show up and ask me questions? I'm from Ellanjeans, but I'm currently living in Ellore. So...  Hmm, I can't deny that I have information. This pendant belongs to my friend Beoul, the coyote. He's in charge of developing new weapons using gunpowder.  Recently, I heard he was killed during one of his experiments. It's top secret for fear Tullan would find out, but you're already aware of it.  Maybe the conflict betwen the two countries will keep going, which doesn't concern me. That's all. Would you please give me the pendant? He used to be my buddy, so I'd like him to rest in peace.																																								1.

That's why monsters both here and in Syllancium envy this place, but there are many layers of magic protecting the village and the secret that lies behind it. Not even the citizens of Ellore know the secret, but recently a traveler hiding in this village stole a document I had. It's the document that describes one of the many entrances into Ellore.

Legend has it that there are ancient ruins below the village. I guess the minor races who were driven into that area didn't care about such things when they first started building there. Anyway, we've heard a rumor that the door leading to the ruins below recently opened and monsters of all kinds came out. We normally don't concern ourselves with what happens in Silancium, but we have to this time since one of our people was hurt.  Fortunately, records of the ruins remain in the Village Of Seeth. Find the Ruins Record Stone Tablet on the rock southeast of the village and  take it to Adventurer Indee south of the village. He has extensive knowledge on ancient ruins.

They've been plotting to kill the Guild Master. He found out about it and came to me. Their actions can't be forgiven, but since they're so strong, we can't easily punish them either. So I've decided to save the Guild Master first. Here's my plan. We'll go hunting and fake his death, pretending he's been killed by monsters. We can't bring any guild members along on this hunting trip, or they'll figure it out right away. So I considered going alone with him, but that might look suspicious. I have to ask you to join us. Are you sure you want to help us? What a loyal traveler you are. Let me tell you what part you'll play in the plan. It's pretty straightforward. Just hunt thirty-five Lamia Ladies in Ivory Grave Village. That should be enough.	You'll help us a lot just by destroying thirty-five Lamia Ladies in Ivory Grave Village. Please!	Oh, that's hard.

The seal is made of a metal called Studium. It will not melt or burn in fire, so don't worry. Throw the Guild Master's Seal into the burner in Ivory Grave Village.

They're worked up because they couldn't find it, but if you really did as I told you... It means only one thing. The monsters in the area took it. The average person would have trouble taking it without using some device, but not the monsters. I think the Steel Turkaven is a possibility. His beak is like metal and it doesn't feel any heat.

Careful observation is a key to being successful and recently I was searching the ruins in Silancium in hopes of finding an Ancient Recipe. Instead, I found a mysterious Silver Box. I knew right away it wasn't an old relic, but it was too beautiful for a woman not to keep. Plus, it didn't seem to have an owner, so I brought it home with me. Since then, I've been getting scary letters saying I stole someone's belongings. These bandits threated that they would kill me unless I returned it by today, but I haven't been able to yet, because now the area's full of monsters.

Silancium and Windrill in the northern area are both incredibly barren. The magic storm that hit Windrill dried out Silancium as well. The blessings of the Elementals are the only thing that keep Shinewood so bountiful. That's why the people of Shinewood are always thankful and work hard to preserve the woods. They're also working to restore Silancium so it's always green. Strangers don't realize it, but every year a group makes sure Le Cidul's sap is passed on to trees in Silancium. But this year, it seems the person in charge didn't do a very good job. I'd like you to go check. Bring the Sap Pot from under the roots of the tree in the Ghost Valley.	The tree sucks up the sap from the Sap Pot and grows leaves. The animals then eat these leaves and become prey to other predators.  That's how life is sustained in Chantra, spreading the blessed energy of Shinewood little by little into Silancium. Well, that's what the plan is anyway. That's why the Sap Pot has been buried there. Go to the tree in the Ghost Valley, dig up the Sap Pot from under its roots and bring it back to me.	Let me see. Give me the Sap Pot... That's weird.

He said he came here to execute the King's order to make a Map of Silancium, but he's not exactly skilled in the martial arts, so I followed him into the desert. Unfortunately, I lost him there. He was right in front of me, but he disappeared quickly and I haven't seen him since. I'm afraid he may have been killed by a monster, but I can't lose him like this. Will you help me? Well, yes. I think we could be excellent partners. Let's start by destroying twenty-five Fire Ghouls in the Ghost Valley in the northern area. The first target will try to open an escape route if he survives, but I'll also be out there hunting. Well, let's go!

They say they've killed the traveler and showed me his ring as proof. It's a memorable ring. Big opal on it. I'm sure he'd never give it up. Of course I refused at first. Have to keep up my professional reputation. But they'll be back, and they'll kill me if I stand in their way again. To be honest, I'd give them the item, but I don't have the key I need. As usual, I gave the key to the traveler. The thieves said some monsters took the key. They want me to break open the safe. I can't do that. Can you search for the key? If monsters really did take it, a traveler like you should be able to find it. Search for the Travelers’ Safe Key after destroying the Duriven Searchers in Death Plain.

Maybe they think of it as an invasion into their space, I don't know, but we've had to stop work on the most important part of the project. It shouldn't be like this. You have two things to do.

I'm thinking about collecting old metal and melting it down. Can you help me? Oh, it's not difficult. All you have to do is collect old iron. A lot of travelers have died northeast of Vampire Village, and you could find plenty of Rusty Armor near the tree root there.	As more travelers aim to be Archlord, the price of metal will go up.

If you've been to Battle Square, you've heard of her. Yes, that Basarah. The one who ruined Battle Square. No one is really sure where she went after that. According to some rumors, she's following a traveler in a black robe. I heard she left everything behind in Syllancium when she took up with him. If that's true, she must have left behind the Medicine of Immortal Life. I want to get it from her belongings, but I need more information. I recently heard Traveler Elba talking about Basarah with a traveler from the east. Go to Traveler Elba in front of the south gate of the village and ask her. Pretend you're just happening by.	Don't forget. Go to Traveler Elba in front of the south gate of the village.	Oh, do you know the story? So far it remains to be confirmed. I don't even know what she looks like, but a visitor recently told me a long story about her. Now you've come in talking about her, too. What a coincidence! Hmm, come to think of it...

I've heard so many stories, I can't remember clearly. Oh, yes. Now I remember the story about the Medicine of Immortal Life. I heard the map of where it was hidden is somewhere under a rock West of Death Plains. He said the Map was hidden there. It can be just a rumor, so I can't guarantee it.	Do you want me to tell you one more time? Bring the Map from under a rock west of the Death Plains, if it is there.	Wow, was it really there? Amazing. Can I see it? Wow, this is great. I envy you.

Are you hesitating because you're afraid? Just get the Ring of Snake Eye from the Golems in the Desert Boundaries between Silancium and Windrill.	Did you get it? It was there.

It acts as a boundary with Syllancium and gives water to every plant in Shinewood. The water of the lake is sinking very slowly. We don't know why it's happening, but I think the monsters in Syllancium are planning something. They live in the eastern part, so that's the direction they'll come from. We may find some evidence near there. The monsters would use a Talisman of Absorption. Can you help me? Find the Talisman of Absorption under a rock east of Angspel Lake and give it to Judge Fariannel north of the village.	There's a possibility you won't find it there, but my instinct tells me you will. Find the Talisman of Absorption under a rock east of Angspel Lake and give it to Judge Fariannel north of the village.	I heard it from Mybling.

The monsters getting close to Angspel Lake can do harm to Ellore, so we should prepare. Ellore isn't a village of warriors. Instead, as the mental power of the residents in the village becomes stronger, the magic squares protecting the village will also grow stronger.

Do you know what the fashion is in Dulan these days? Using Soul Stone from Golems to build a house. I'm sure it would be very strong magically and could be used for various purposes, but I hate to see Golems destroyed for such a frivolous purpose. It is such a foolish thing even though it is true. A nobleman of Dulan asked me to get some for him. I owe him a big favor, so I couldn't refuse his request. Can you help me? Bring me thirty-five Soul Stones. The best way to do it is using your Ransacking skill on the Golems south of the Desert Boundaries, but you can get them by other means. You may also be able to buy them.

While I fight with the Golems, I can be attacked from the rear. In fact, since I beat a group of Robatoms for the villagers, I've been their target whenever I've been in Silancium.

The names of various places even originate from that problem. Wanderer Plain is an example. This area in Silancium is especially dry, so travelers often get dehydrated and wander around in a daze. Experienced travelers are prepared for it, but there are always unskilled ones from Tullan who are never heard from again. Ironically that's because so many people travel here from Tullan to search for their friends who were lost in the desert. If we ignore this problem, Ellore will turn into one big crowd of mourning, ill-prepared travelers vying for the chance to be the next ones to go missing. I cannot express the degree to which they are bothering me. As an Elder, I have to solve this problem as soon as possible. I asked Traveler Elba at the south gate of the village to help me, but I don't think she'll be able to manage it alone. She can only join one search party at a time. Help her, please!	Even though the Traveler Elba at the south gate of the village is skilled, she won't be able to look for many missing travelers all at the same time. Help her, please!	Oh, you came to help me!

Their families tried to separate them after discovering the truth, and they ran away together to this village. However, the girl fell ill, so they couldn't keep going somewhere safer. They're hidden somewhere here. Soldiers have followed them from Tullan and they arrived here a few days ago. If they catch the couple, their elopement will be meaningless, and one of them may be killed. I decided to help them, but I'm not so good at fighting. How can you help them? Well, we can hang Worn-out Boots on a branch of the scrub trees in the Hawks' Plateau. The boots were his, and their pursuers will go in that direction, fooled by the boots. You'll do it for me?

He'll give you a solution, so show the Talisman to Sorcerer Ron west of Tullan, and ask about Brambattle.	Did you run all the way here? I'm always ready to help anyone. I won't run away. What can I do for you?																																								1. Deliver the Talisman to Sorcerer Ron in Tullan.																														20200	444320	1366	Jamushi Vs Brambattle

Furthermore, the job is fairly well done. The traveler in a black robe? I've heard rumors of him for a long time, and he must be very violent. Anyway, I'm not sure, but hundreds of Weather Talismans may be in Silancium. Even if we know where they all are, it will take several months to collect them. Hmm. Poison must be controlled by poison. In this case, we'd better wake a sleeping lion. Hahaha! I'm sorry for talking for myself and laughing, but it is funny. Okay, this is the job for you. Get thirty-five Clay Fragments and go to Pilgrim Nox at Jamushi's Seal. You can get the Clay Fragments in various ways but you will get them most effectively by using your Ransacking skill on the Windboar Imps south of Beacon Village. Ask Nox about its effects.	Haven't you left yet? I thought this was an emergency, isn't it? Get thirty-five Clay Fragments using your Ransacking skill on the Windboar Imps south of Beacon Village. Please. Give them to Pilgrim Nox at the Jamushi's Seal and tell him what I said.	What happened? Brambattle this time? I have always worried about the revival of Jamushi here, but it's interesting the same problem is also in other areas. Don't worry too much. We can find a solution if we calm down.

There is one emergency solution in case Brambattle wakes up unexpectedly. I think we should adopt that method. Here is a box. Clay dolls made with the Clay you brought are inside it. The totem pieces of the Sea People are inside the dolls, and any attempt to awaken Brambattle will come to nothing if we spread these dolls around Silancium. A letter inside the box has a detailed explanation, so give this box to Judge Fariannel north of the village.	Hurry up, or you'll be late. Take this box to Judge Farianelle north of the village and he'll do something.	Any good news? I remember the story about Jamushi's Seal, but I have to read the letter for details.

I got an invitation from a captain of Terranoa after the road was reopened. This invitation isn't for everyone. Ha! Ha! Ha! But he asked me to bring ten items to contribute to the warehouse of Terranoa. Hmm, it's a bother, but I'm so thrilled to have my first official trip in a long time. But ten items are too much for me. I've prepared for seven items so far, but now I'm completely exhausted. Can you help me? Oh, thank you. What you should bring is forty Euriale's Talons.

You have the look of a hero upon your face. It's always pleasant to meet new travelers, I see a bright future for you especially at a time when all kinds of people come and go, searching for the Archon to become the Archlord. I am sorry to ask you for a favor on our first acquaintance, but can you go to Blacksmith Brin and ask him whether he finished repairing my Stick? It is Blacksmith Brin Ironsmasher northeast inside the village.	I asked him to repair the Stick quite a while ago, but he hasn't sent it back yet. So, go to Blacksmith Brin, just northeast of the village, and become acquainted to him.	Well, who do I have here? Aren't you a traveler? What are you here for? Oh, right, I forgot.

If I do this job, I will need more time to look for the Elder's Stick. Recently I went hunting, and I stepped on a Dark Spider's Web. So now they're waiting for me to go outside the village for a chance at revenge. I'm not so weak to be easily defeated by them, but it is irritating. So defeat five Dark Spiders. They are definitely there to the east outside the village.	All villagers here have considerable fighting ability, so I reckon you'll need to be at least as strong as they are. Go toward the east of the village and defeat five Dark Spiders.	Are you back already? Defeating five Dark Spiders was nothing, right? Oh, that Stick? Uh...Wait a minute.

So I made this Bat-Repelling Perfume after a great deal of effort, and now I need to apply it around the village. Deliver this perfume to Warrior Weapons Merchant Mecante southeast inside the village.	Mecante will be waiting for you. Deliver this Bat-Repelling Perfume to Warrior Weapons Merchant Mecante southeast inside the village. He will use it wisely.	Bat-Repelling Perfume? It has a smell that repels even us!

That's the name of a Rock Spider living north of the village. It's not an ordinary Rock Spider. It was created to protect an ancient magic long, long ago. But even after the magic disappeared, its instinct still survives to this day. Long ago, it was as big as a house, but fortunately it is much smaller now. Still, it poses grave problems for the villagers, and many have suffered. It will be difficult to defeat him with our bare hands as it is locked in magic. So I asked Trujillo to find a way to defeat it. I think he's had time to come up with a way, so go to Magic Trainer Trujillo south of the village.	I asked him to do it a long time ago, so he must have made some progress. Stop being lazy and go to Magic Trainer Trujillo south inside the village.	Oh, right. I've heard about it. But what can I do? I've been so busy I couldn't even get on that project. I don't like Tickle because he's so arrogant.

Then convey my message that the Earth's Eye is now gone, so he can hunt freely.	Be quick. If you dawdle like that, the monster will bite you.

Okay if you want the weapons back, then defeat five Green Molds near the Grave of the Dead. Then I'll think about it.	Well, it doesn't matter if you don't do it, since after all, this is none of your business. But you won't turn a blind eye to it, will you? To live in this village comfortably, you need to help your neighbors. So defeat five Green Molds near the Grave of the Dead.	Hmm, good job.

Sometimes people earn lots of money while hunting Bats because the Cave Bats sometimes go to that cave and accidentally pick up gold on their bodies. According to the rumors, one of the Cave Bats living south of Crowcross has a Ring on its toe. The Ring must have gotten on the toe by accident. So the owner of that Ring should be me, Morien. I will put it up for sale on the open market and probably receive a high price for it. So defeat the Cave Bat and bring the Ring to me.	Isn't it a simple quest? Destroy the Cave Bat living south of Crow Cross and bring me back the Ring.	It's very difficult to get one, so I'm well aware of how much effort you put into this quest. Good job!

Morien doesn't have to do it because it was you who first found the ring. So defeat ten Silk Eyeballs north of the Plunder's Plains. Of course, then you should run to Item Trader Morien in front of the east gate of the village to verify the condition of the ring.	Isn't the sorcerer smart? He tried to seek his revenge by using others. But of course, he cannot be praised for such an idea. Well, defeat ten Silk Eyeballs in the northern part of the Zeno Plain.

So our villagers raise boar and deer. But at their hearts they're still wild animals, so if we manage them poorly, they turn fierce. Garot, over by the Graves of the Dead, is good example. He was smart. One day he broke the fence and escaped, forming a group with other boars. Our village has invested a lot in raising Garot, so we can't just let our investment go. We need the money. I heard if we can defeat Chief Garot, then the other boars will naturally just return to their home. That's exactly what you have to do. Defeat Chief Garot at the Graves of the Dead and bring back Garot's Tooth. We are hoping that the other boars will return if they see Chief Garot's Tooth in our possession.	This is a broad plan, and it feels bad sacrificing a Garot. But if we can gain much by losing one Garot, then it's a worthwhile sacrifice. Defeat the Chief Garot at the Grave of the Dead and bring back the Garot's Tooth.	Good job! With the tooth you brought back, the hunters can hunt down the Boars.

I want to have that traveler's Rusty Dagger back. Defeat the Blood Cubes east of the Grave of the Dead and bring back the Rusty Dagger.	If you're going to stand there like that and not move on, I will have to ask someone else to do the quest. So, last chance.

Go to Elder Brusoto in the center of the village and ask him where the Sword of Darkness is.	The Sword of Darkness? I don't know what that is. But recently I saw a sword flying through the night and it gave me such a horrible feeling. I will punish the person who made such an awful thing.

I have assisted Shadow Warriors like you for a long time in this village. Of course, this was a secret to others. This post was created since it is difficult to see what's happening in all of Golundo all the time, given the distance between Golundo and Trilgard. Every time a new Shadow Warrior is designated, I test whether he is worthy or not. So you need to show me what you've got. All you have to do is defeat ten Vipers north of Valbur Hill.	Don't forget. What you have to do is defeat ten Vipers north of Valbre Hill.	Now I see why you were chosen. The King certainly has an eye for talent. I'm relieved someone like you is working for Trilgard.

Go to Bura northeast inside the village.	If the fire was made by an ordinary person, water would have been enough to extinguish it. But a fire created by the power of magic can only be extinguished with the power of magic. There are many ways, but in cases like these, we always turn to Bura for help.

This time, it was likely the result of somebodys curse. To stop the fire, I need material to make a talisman. I need Ice Flowers, which grow in the plains near Golundo although there is a problem with that. The Ice Flowers grow near the Grunt Peninsula, where Viper Warriors live. They really like Ice Flowers, so they will undoubtedly fight tooth and nail to protect them. So if you could defeat ten Viper Warriors for me I can quickly grab the Ice Flowers.	Without the Ice Flower, there can be no alchemy. We can't extinguish the fire, either. Do you understand me? Hurry up and defeat ten Viper Warriors near the Groont Peninsula.

Now we have to make him pay for this. He has something called the Water Jewel, which he keeps hidden out in the rocks. It allows him to summon awesome power even in places where no water exists, as long as he possesses the jewel. If he loses the Water Jewel, his power will diminish immediately. He will learn his lesson if you can find me the Water Jewel among the rocks south of Balbre Hill.	It's our only chance. He'll have no power if you get me the Water Jewel from among the rocks south of Balbre Hill.	The revenge is complete. Do I want to destroy him? I have no interest in doing that.

He's concerned Golundo isn't more influential in the region. The King, like our ancestors, is always worried about small local tribes getting too defiant.  So naturally he was furious when Goblin Chief Ciroro started showing up right near Golundo. We need a plan to defeat Ciroro. A frontal attack on his people will never work. But one on one we have a chance. We should start by defeating Bashiva, Ciroro's right-hand man. Bashiva lives near Kandia Mine.	Even seemingly weak and useless Goblins can become threats if they gather in large numbers. So they are the ones we need to look out for most around this area. Defeat Goblin Scout Bashiva near Kandia Mine.	Good job!

I heard from Magic Weapons Merchant Charlize that if I can get the Comfort Talisman, I will be able to sleep soundly again. I think I can get it if you can help me out. Goblin Rangers have the Comfort Talisman, so defeat the Goblin Rangers at the Bala Plain and bring me the Comfort Talisman.	I think they might be suffering from the same thing as us.

I am referring to the Temple of the Land south of Solcid Mountain Range. Of course, the temple they build wasn't anything compared to what you see nowadays but our ancestors who bowed at the temple received the Revelation from the Earth Elemental to stay in that land. You should follow in their footsteps. Go to the Temple of the Land in the southern area and bow at the temple. Then bring back the Box of Sacrifices.	You should not disrespect our ancestors' traditions. Hurry and go to the Temple of the Land in the southern area and bow. Then bring back the Box of Sacrifices.	The box symbolizes the Elemental's Revelation. Like the Revelation, no one knows what's in the box. You should not look inside either. It represents our ancestors' belief in what they had not seen.

Now it's time for you to show us you will become an Orc as strong as him, and that you will follow his example, his courage. Defeat ten Young Direwolves at the Algema Basin. This quest is nothing compared to what our ancestors had to go through.	It is a true victory to best a strong enemy. Defeat ten Young Direwolves at the Algema Basin.	It's not something you can see, but your valor is ingrained in you. It proves you've got more power within than any of the things you've done or brought back during the festival.

I think it will be possible to conquer the lands they dominate one by one, because the two places are far apart. Conquering Ciroro is more urgent as he recently started gathering his tribe members. It will become more difficult if he gathers more soldiers, so I think now is the best time to face him. Go to the Bala Plains and defeat the Goblin Chief Ciroro.	He will not be defeated easily, but you can do it! Go to the Bara Plains and defeat the Goblin Chief Ciroro.	You've made it! Your ability is amazing! Although chaotic, I heard Ciroro's power is quite threatening. Thanks to you, the Goblin's power is now weak. There is only one thing left now.

Meizo has a Jewel called Reptile's Eye. The King wants to have it, so go to the Groont Peninsula and bring it back after defeating the Viper King Meizo.	You have no time to waste! Go to the Groont Peninsula and bring the Reptile's Eye back after defeating the Viper King Meizo.	You have killed two chiefs! I think I need to reassess your ability!

Some items that were coming to me have disappeared as well, so it bothers me a lot. I would like to ask you to go there for me and find out what happened. Go to Merchant Burbur of Nortop Village and ask him what's going on.	The cause is pretty obvious when items disappear in such a small village like that. So go to Merchant Burbur of Nortop Village.

You haven't said it exactly, but I can tell by the way you look at me. The truth is, a huge rock fell from the sky and a part of the warehouse was smashed. Young Lycantos began taking advantage of the situation, stealing things like crazy. Since they outnumber the villagers, it is almost impossible to guard the warehouse against them. Please defeat ten Young Lycantos outside Nortop Village. We can talk after you do that for me.	I told you that we can talk after the quest is completed. Defeat ten Young Lycantos and kick the rest out of the village.	Wow, your ability obviously outpaces others. No wonder Golundo selected you to come here. Oh, right, you're not here for that.

But I couldn't just stop working until the warehouse was rebuilt again, so the monsters are getting in and stealing items in the meantime. It would be great if I could stop them, but that's difficult at the moment. Of course, Zion would think his items are so precious, but to us, our work is more important. So, would you help us out? I had an item stolen, a Golden Scroll. I wanted to send it to Safe Keeper Tess of Golundo. She begged me to get it to her, even if getting it back was incredibly difficult. Fortunately, I attached a magic talisman to it, so I can track its location. The Golden Scroll is among the rocks south of the Belliga Basin. Please find it for me.	I think the monsters that took it might be the Bronzedran. They have a natural ability to see magical items. So, find the Golden Scroll among the rocks south of the Belliga Basin.	This is it! This is the scroll that will turn anything into gold just by reading it. But it's pretty useless. You can't read the language written on the scroll with just earthly knowledge. In short, it is useless without a sufficient level of knowledge. Still, there are people who are searching for it, so we will be completing our quest just by delivering the scroll to them.

On the outside, the wound seems minor. But since the monster was poisonous, the villager is now in great pain. There were Antidote Potions in the warehouse, but all were broken when the rock fell onto the warehouse. Of course, I have one, but since I'm a merchant, I can't give it to you for free. If you have the ability, buy an Antidote Potion from me. It will be very useful to them.	Don't think I'm stingy. I mean, I am a merchant. If I give things out for free, I'll go bankrupt. So buy one Antidote Potion from me. You'll be able to save that villager's life.	That was close. He was barely able to survive the poison, but he's breathing comfortably now. I owe this all to you.

I don't care whether you ask a famous cook to make it or cook it yourself. Just get it. You can get the Viper Meat by using your Carving skill on the Vipers.	The Manticores have highly sensitive noses and they come for food from hundreds of miles away, following the scent.

Defeat some Young Manticores near Nortop Village and get two Manticore's Tails by using your Ransacking skills.	I doubt this will work because it's not even a corpse, just a mere tail.

He's just southeast of the city.	What brought you here? Haha... The Box of Dadhal. I heard about it once. It was a box belonging to the ancient tribes and contained the curse of a snake. A lady sent the box to a witch she was jealous of, but the witch hid it somewhere deep inside the village. You must have dug up that box. That's the way Mirku is... full of tricks...

You have nothing to do with Commander Burke, but you can make all the difference. The mercenary raid on DadHal, as far as I know, was to find Maxo's Treasure Chest. What lies within is unknown, so that makes it very intriguing. But Maxo is a smart fellow and keeps the chest far from his home. His own subordinates may be after it, too. He hid the chest underneath the Relics of Battna Site. You need tremendous courage to go near the Ruins. But I bet you qualify for the job. Get the chest back.	What are you doing? Let's go have some fun! Get Maxo's Treasure Chest hidden underneath the Relics of Battna Ruins.	Wow! This is it... What are you looking at?

Defeat the Thief Soldier Maxo near Dadhal. And once you're done, go to Mercenary Bobum and ask about the results.	The longer you delay, the more severe the mercenaries' pain becomes. Commander Burke will get angry, too. Come on... Defeat the Thief Soldier Maxo near Dadhal.  And once you're done, go to Mercenary Bobum and ask about the results.	Thank you. You saved our lives. By the way, did you happen to see anything that looked like a treasure? No? Never mind. The treasure can't be there... I'm just happy everyone's back safe. Dam...It's quite embarrassing.

He probably knows because he's from the same tribe as the miners at Gnome Cave. You should go ask Blacksmith Tol Dulhead northwest of the city.	I have no idea if it's a secret of the Gnome or a secret in all of Kuhn. What is certain is that somebody isn't telling the truth. Go ask Blacksmith Tol Dulead northwest of the city.	What are you here for? With that look on your face? Demon? That's a child's story if I've ever heard one! The Demon is a bedtime story for babies. Never mind about the rumor. It's nothing.

Recently, a thief of Kuhn committed an unthinkable crime. He stole a jewel from the Defense Magic Team of Kuhn and crossed the bridge. Mercenaries of Kuhn can't go after the criminal unless it's a simple hunting. So I'm asking you to go there instead. Mine Mystic Eye in the Old Mine might have been a witness. Go to him first.	The longer you delay this, the more time the criminal will have to run. Go immediately to Mine Mystic Eye in the Old Mine.	A thief? Well...

We have to hunt the Flamebear, but what's more important is the Money Chest. I'm pretty sure he went to the Flamebear gathering. If you destroy eight Flamebears near the Old Mine, we will ransack the corpses and find the Money Chest. This'll mean you've caught the criminal as well, right?	What's the wait? Are you confident you'll be able to find him among so many Flamebears? Go now and get eight Flamebears near the Old Mine and we will look for the Money Chest.	We could find the chest...

A member of our tribe said he saw him hide something under a rock along the way. Maybe he didn't want us to have it even if we captured him, but that's all of no use to us now he's dead. Oh, what you should do is simple. Find the Magic Square Jewel under the rock east of Dadhal. If you find it there, you can give it to Mayor Dason near the Portal of Kuhn.	Well, we cleared up all our problems, but I'm giving you this advice, so hurry up. Find the Magic Square Jewel under the rock east of Dadhal.

The first thing you should do is to bring Oriharcon Ingot to use in making the dagger. As far as I know, Alchemist Montro, just northeast of the city, has it.	I told you this is urgent. You really don't understand what I said. Go northeast of the city, meet and ask Alchemist Montro for an Oriharcon Ingot.

Do you know, a guild leader has nothing to do with his martial art skills or magical power? It doesn't make sense! Maybe you can help me. You know Gateway Village? There's a tree famous for rare flowers near the village. Bring a Very Poisonous flower from the tree. If I brew a weak potion and drink it, I won't really die but I'll seem to be dead. Then I could avoid having to take the lead.	Oh, don't worry, I know how to use it. If I brew a weak potion and drink it, I won't die I'll just look dead.

You should prove you're different from those stupid soldiers. Search the jagged rocks at the Dusty Creek and bring me Usus's Letter.	It's the Letter of Usus.

All of the famous sorcerers in the city were totally defeated by a Lamia Maid in a magic duel. I knew it would happen. Orcs and magic, the two things just don't go together. I'm not trying to belittle any particular class, but in the end, strength is an Orc's greatest weapon. Anyway, it seems that a Venison Pie is needed to cure those stupefied sorcerers. You! Do you know how to cook? Whatever you do, just get it and take it to Magic Trainer Lytillo North of the city.	I'm telling you to do it because I personally don't think it's worth my time. Get a Pie of Healing and give it to Magic Trainer Lytillo north of the city.	As a matter of fact, I expected that.

His might and valor had no equal, but he had too many enemies and they finally caught up to him, joining together to slay him. Just before he died he asked to be buried with his sword, and his last wish was honored. Unfortunately, that's not the end of the story. Every night of the full moon, the sword escapes from his tomb and lurks in the streets. Anyone who happens by, whoosh! Scary, huh? You could bring peace to this frightened city. First find the Cursed Sword in the Warrior's Tomb by the Temple of Time. Then take it to Warrior Weapons Merchant Traltran south of Trilgard Square. He'll explain why, heh.	It's very simple. Go to the Warrior's Tomb at the Temple of Time, find the Cursed Sword and give it to Warrior Weapons Merchant Traltran south of Trilgard Square. Not to me.	Hah, you really don't know anything. He asked you to do this because he owed me something. Apparently you fell for his line and brought the sword to me. Well, it's understandable. There are all kinds of dreadful stories about this sword. Dipo must have wanted to stay as far away from it as possible, that arrogant coward. Oh, there's no need to make that face. No matter how wicked a weapon is, I'm sure there won't be any problems as long as the person who holds it stays alert. This seems to be part of your destiny.

Fortunately, my family has a secret method to purify cursed swords, but I need some special materials to lift the curse. One of them is Lamia's Venom. I heard Archer Trainer Gorgan recently went out hunting and got some. Please get it from him. Go to Archer Trainer Gorgan south of Trilgard Square.	Please hurry, someone else might be looking for Lamia's Venom as well. Go to Archer Trainer Gorgan south of Trilgard Square.	Oh, Lamia's Venom? It's out of stock.

Jimbo's pack has been living in the area a long time. Shuta's horde recently came from the other side of the Terratoga Mountains. The clash between these two had some unexpected consequences. Shuta's horde occupied the Shrine of Time to get the legendary weapon 'Gasz.' It's very difficult to get rid of them as they guard their lives with magic. It's been months since it happened.

Long ago, before we even came to Chantra, there was a flying city in the skies above Chantra. It was destroyed in a terrible battle and fell far to the north. Parts of the city scattered across the land. Some say those pieces still have the Talisman of Flight, that kept the city in the air. One of them was apparantly found by a rock near the Dusty Creek of Silancium. Please go and get the Talisman.	It's very precious and sought after by many. Looks like the Spriggans have noticed what we're doing. Hurry to the rock near the Dusty Creek of Silancium and find the Talisman of Flight.	Great. Now that we have most of the materials, I just need to focus on some details. I hope this will work as planned. You can take a break and get ready for the next step. Just don't let your guard down completely.																				165675431	1687	Talisman of Flight	1																	1. Find the Talisman of Flight by a rock at Dusty Creek.	6	2.

The Spriggans found out about our plan and stole the flying machine just before its completion, only moments ago. No doubt, this is a huge setback. We lost all the materials we gathered so far. You know.... I can't just let this happen. Let's follow them and reclaim the parts. You need to be a pursuer in this. Go to the Village of Rest and destroy fifteen Spriggan Combatants to cut off their line of retreat.	Nobody knows what they might do when they're up against a wall. Let's hurry. Go to the Village of Rest and destroy fifteen Spriggan Combatants to cut off their line of retreat.	Oh, all our efforts were in vain. As soon as they saw us, they torched our flying machine. Since it was made of wood, it burned very quickly. We can collect the other materials again, but there's no way to get another Talisman of Flight. We'd better give up this plan. But it's not over yet. No, we have to fight more fiercely. Please wait here until I need you again. Just don't relax quite yet.						302	Spriggan Combatant	15																																1.

Unless you drive them away, you won't even be able to get close. If you do that for me, I'll do whatever I can to find the Spell. I know you can do it.

We were talking about who's better as a trainer, and this Archer Trainer Gorgan said warriors were too stupid to develop fully. You know what I did? I challenged him and we made a bet. If I succeed in finding something he hides, he says he will never underestimate warriors again. All I have to do is simply find the thing and prove my senses are as good as an archers. The problem is, I'm supposed to find it, but I can't leave right now. I have a bad hangover, so I need your help. Gorgan said he hid a Water Bottle beneath a rock near Elemental Waterfall. As soon as you locate that Bottle, go to the Archer Trainer Gorgan south of Trilgard Square.	This is a really important bet, a duel. It would be a piece of cake if I wasn't feeling so sick. Then I wouldn't be asking you for anything. But please, as soon as you find the Water Bottle hidden beneath the rock near Elements Waterfall, go to Archer Trainer Gorgan, south of Trilgard Square.	Hmm, this is the Water Bottle. Why did you bring it here? Oh, Kildemor told you to bring it to me. That sounds suspicious... Well, I'll take it anyway, but I'll definitely laugh if I find out Kildemor wasn't the one who found it. But that's not the problem right now. There's something more important.

He said, Archers empty a whole quiver for a monster I can bring down with a single magic bolt. I said I could prove him wrong. The problem is, I was supposed to hunt down Skeletons and collect fifteen Skeleton's Bones as evidence by now. But my bow broke in half last night. I'm sorry to ask you, but please do this for me. You can't tell Lytillo, of course, but can you get those bones using your Ransacking skill on the Skeleton Knights in the Algema Basin? When you have fifteen, show them to Magic Trainer Lytillo north of the city.	This isn't the act of a coward. I just have no other choice. Use your Ransacking skill on the Skeleton Knights in the Algema Basin to get fifteen Skeleton's Bones, and show them to Magic Trainer Lytillo north of the city.	You came on behalf of Gorgan? Well, he must have been pretty mad at me. I was just joking, but now he sent the Skeleton's Bones. Anyway, you must have travelled a long way. I'd love to let you take a rest, but I have a small favor to ask of you. Please wait.			998	Skeleton's Bone	15																																			1. Get fifteen Skeletons' Bones.	11	2.

I'm furious. He mocked all the sorcerers of the past, present and future. He said sorcerers know nothing of the world and can't even find precious objects hidden in corpses. He was clearly throwing down the gauntlet. I vowed I would get what he wanted after destroying some monsters, but I have to attend some urgent matters right now. I would appreciate it if you could do it for me. Kill Spriggan Warriors and find Kildemor's Stolen Food. Then, of course, go to Warrior Trainer Kildemor south of Trilgard Square to show him the evidence.	If you take too long, people might think I'm an unqualified trainer. So destroy Spriggan Warriors, take Kildemor's Stolen Food back and show the evidence to Warrior Trainer Kildemor south of the city.	Uh, this is my food. Spriggan Warriors stole it from me. And you're saying Kildemor got it back? Hmm... He may not be that bad after all. Of course, he's still not in my league. Ha-ha. Anyhow, I beat Gorgan, and Kildemor beat me.

He used to be a warrior, so General Quig should be on my side. Buy a bottle of Cool Seasoning from the cook, give it to General Quig at the east gate of Trilgard Square and ask him to make a judgment.	Hmm. Cool Seasoning. My favorite. But I can't waste my time on Kildemor's stupid idea. I saw what you did as a go-between with the three trainers. None of them did the work on their own, so nobody wins. Rather, I declare them all losers! They all need to learn a lesson.

I'm the one who told the Spriggans about the Temple of Time. Why was I with them? A peddler like myself doesn't really receive fair treatment in Trilgard, that's one of the reasons. And Spriggans were Gnomes originally. In fact, I never knew they would misuse the information like that. It's not really my fault! Doesn't that make sense? Well I guess I provided the fundamental cause. So let me tell you something to make up for my mistake. The origin of the magic the Spriggans cast in the Temple of Time is an ancient magic. You can find out what it is from the Scroll at Barandike Fortress. Find the Scroll and give it to Mayor Prosto east of the city, but tell him nothing about me.	You know it's not a good idea to waste time here. Hurry up. Find the Scroll at the Barandyke Fortress and give the Scroll to Mayor Prosto east of the city.	What is this? Oh, I see. If this is what you say it is, nothing could be more important. But where did you get it? You can't say, because you're protecting someone's identity? Then I'll ask no more.

Mayor Prosto of Trilgard sent you? What's going on? Hmm, I've heard of Omnipotent Herb. It has powerful effects, but it's nearly impossible to find. It grows underground and appears only once a year, but I'll give it a try. Mayor Prosto does make some difficult requests.			1383	Scroll of Unlimited Food	1																																			1.

You may not know about this, but Humans and Spriggans are fighting against each other in the King's Hunting Field. The Herb may grow there, but I don't think I can get away from those Spriggans. If you can take out twenty Spriggan Chasers at the Qualt Camp near the King's Hunting Field, I'll look around for the Herb.	It's dangerous for both of us, so you'd better stop wasting time. I mean it. Hurry up. Destroy twenty Spriggan Chasers at the Qualt Camp near the King's Hunting Field.	The Omnipotent Herb wasn't there.

He accepted your present instantly and agreed to the exchange, but he's worried the Herb might be stolen in transit and says he'll send it eastward by balloon. So, if you just wait in Trilgard, the Herb will be there. No need to worry. You don't believe me, do you?  If it doesn't arrive there in time, I'll take the full responsibility. Just don't worry. Deliver my message to Mayor Prosto, east of Trilgard Square.	You haven't left yet. You still don't believe me, but he will. Just tell Mayor Prosto east of Trilgard Square what I said.	Well done. What happened? Hmm. Well, who knows what will happen, but I trust Aliti. He'll take care of everything along the way, and at least that person with the Herb won't just cheat us.

We need to persuade the people of Zylok, and they're not on friendly terms with us. I guess it would be better for you, an outsider, to go there. At present, Security Chief Koop has full control over Zylok. Go meet Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of Zylok, and make sure you bring him some gifts.

Magic Trainer Telecaster knows how to deal with this kind of thing, but he won't do me any favors. His followers aren't big fans of mine. Someday they'll get what they deserve, but right now I need his help. Go to Telecaster southeast of the village.	Why are you still here? Go to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village, and tell him about my situation.	Koop's been cursed? The rash you talked about is called the Curse of the Dead. It's not from living beings. There are many ways to deal with it, but I have to know the cause first. Do you have any idea what might have caused it?																																								1.

943	Zylok and Koop	Fury of Souls	Zylok; Telecaster	1		43				2	942	Rash Magic	<Magic Trainer> Telecaster	<Magic Trainer> Telecaster				I heard the story. Koop has a real grudge against humans. That's why he hates Ghost Thieves. But the Ghost Thieves in Syllancium all have their own stories, too. They were Humans who were destroyed in the Battle of Monsters six months ago. Human warriors came here through the portal. Some of them returned safely to their own land, but others died in Syllancium. They have lingering ill will toward the Orcs, and now Koop has fanned the fire. I'd better find a solution. First let's appease those souls. Bring me fifteen pieces of Dragon Meat. You can get them using your Meat Carving skill on the Dark Wyverns in the Dusty Creek.	What are you doing? Shouldn't you be gone? Bring me fifteen pieces of Dragon Meat. You can get it using your Meat Carving skill on the Dark Wyverns at the Dusty Creek.	Good job. Dragon Meat is tough and gamy, so it's not good for eating, but it has strong natural powers. That's why it  is used often as an ingredient in magic. Wait for a second.			1025	Dragon Meat	15																																			1. Get fifteen pieces of Dragon Meat.	11	2.

Let's talk about it after lifting the curse. They said they attached a Talisman of Curses to a relic south of Milieu, where Koop couldn't find it. Retrieve it and give it to Security Chief Koop at the west gate of the village. He should burn it himself.	As long as the Talisman stays where it is, the curse on Koop can never be lifted. Find the Talisman of Curses on a relic south of Milieu and give it to Security Chief Koop at the west gate of the village. Tell him to burn it himself.	You've been there? What's this talisman? Oh, I see. I should burn it. Great, great. I'll burn whatever I need to. Then things will get better?																				165609583	2616	Talisman of Curse	1																	1.

Give it to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village.	He wouldn't dare cross me. Here, take my Throwing Knife to Magic Trainer Castor southeast of the village.	Indeed, Koop's most precious possession is a weapon. This should do the trick. It would be better if he could present it to the Ghosts himself, but I'll do it instead this time.

Village of Thieves, Robber's Home, that kind of thing. There are so many mercenaries, security is a mess here. Robberies and thievery are everyday occcurances...  They're like swarms of mosquitoes. But Security Chief Koop doesn't really care about security, rather he encourages the mercenaries to do bad things. My safe is not protected from the mercenaries either, but I don't know what to do. I recently lost my Gold Nugget. I may need to negotiate with them. Can you go to Mercenary Scar at the north gate of the village and talk to him about my offer?	This is urgent. Hurry to Mercenary Scar at the north gate of the village and talk to him about this matter.	I heard about Kellog's problems several times from other people, but even the mercenaries have their own opinions. There's no evidence we did it, you know. That's jumping to conclusions.

Go to the Wind Plains and destroy the Hobgoblin Leaders to avenge us and our reputation. About twenty-five of them will do.	Why do you have to go? You should go see their true identity fior yourself.

You be a witness of the test.	Look at the time. Go destroy Hobgoblin Leaders in the Wind Plains, get the Hard Crystal, and give it to Adventurer Felicia northeast of the village.	What's this? A crystal? Are you giving me a gift? A test? Oh, a challenge. I heard about her, but I didn't really mean to provoke her. I guess now she's challenged me, I can't back down. Ahah! See?

Destroy twenty Crasher Werewolves near the Baran Dyke Fortress.	Ah, you're back. What happened? Well, we were sparring when those Crasher Werewolves showed up. We joined forces to drive them away, but by then we were too tired to fight each other, so we agreed to spar again another time.

Around one hundred million Gold! That's what I call a business. The book? After some research, we found out that the Moon Elf Dallain unearthed it in Silancium. The one who told me turned a deathly pale and said the book is the Ancient Document of the Ones who Pursued a Great Power. But a single document couldn't have that much magic, could it? Anyhow, I have to go to finish the negotiations. Moon Elves have implanted these things called Beast Jewels into the foreheads of monsters in the area. They can control those monsters at will now. If things turn bad, they could attack me with those monsters, so I'm going to bring my men with me. Oh, and I'm going to deal with this beforehand. I have an order for you. We're going to meet Moon Elves at the Baran Dyke Fortress. Destroy the Dark Wyverns there and bring me five Beast Jewels! Understand?	The meeting is set. You'd better hurry. Destroy the Dark Wyverns at the Barandyke Fortress and bring me five Beast Jewels.	I dealt a really good blow to them. One tried to summon a monster as I expected, but it failed since you took the jewel out of the monster's forehead. They had to accept all my terms. Of course they'll get the book they wanted. If you have a very powerful weapon, you may get hurt yourself if you keep wielding it too often. That's common knowledge.

One of my friends discovered the bodies of some Moon Elves in Syllancium a while ago and buried them. I didn't think much about it at that time, but now that I heard Koop met Moon Elf envoys,  I remembered my friend said those bodies were dressed in Moon Elves' official uniforms. But these so-called envoys never asked any questions about the dead ones. So I did a little bit of investigating myself, and I saw them talking to some unknown Orcs more than once. What I'm saying is that they may not be real Moon Elf envoys. If those bodies were proven to be the real Moon Elf envoys, Koop might have second thoughts, right? The evidence is buried in Syllancium. Moon Elf envoys always carry Karafel's Imperial Sword and Belange's Document with them. My colleague must have buried them together with the bodies. You'll be able to find them under a rock north of the Wind Plains. When you find them, give them to Security Chief Koop at the west gate of the village and tell him what I said.	They're supposedly buried with dead bodies, so don't be surprised when you see the corpses. Look under the rocks north of the Wind Plain.

It's beautiful, isn't' it? So, you've got try hard. Please recover the traveler's Ashes from a rock in the Dusty Creek.	Now the dead man will be back with his friends.

964	Golden Arrow	Hunting a Thief	Zylok; Motto	1		44				2			<Archer Trainer> Moto	<Archer Trainer> Moto				Well, your arrival is timely. We bought a Golden Arrow from Western merchants recently. Although it's not pure Gold, the arrowhead is Gold with strong magical powers. It's always a hundred percent accurate and can be a real lifesaver in an emergency. This precious arrow was stolen by a thief Harpy. I'm so angry.... but that won't help me find it. It's time to show my talent as a hunter and tracker, I guess. I'll follow its traces. This is quite urgent because we're in real trouble if he runs too far away. So, bring me one Hindseeker Armpads. Mine is too old and useless. Can you do me that favor?	Armpads are the only Orc defensive device we Satyroses can wear. Come on, hurry up and get one Hindseeker Armpad.	Hey, you're late! Oh, I shouldn't say that when you've done all the work. Thank you. I snapped at you because I'm so worried about the thief getting away. Thank you again.			705	Hindseeker Armpads	1																																			1.

You search the Dusty Creek. It's vast and empty so it's easy to find even minor evidence. Among tree branches or rocks is possible. I don't know what kind of trail he might have left, but since we found a Bloody Feather here, you might be lucky enough to find more. Come on... Let's follow his trail and track him down.	Well, I haven't left yet, but what about you? This isn't good... We'd better hurry. Go search among the tree branches or under rocks in Dusty Creek for proof, like a Bloody Feather.	Hmm... My guess was right... This feather is just like the other one... Nothing in the North, so he must be going South. Let's think about his position...

After driving away those Moon Elves, I didn't feel very relieved. So I did a little research and concluded that I'm not the one that should have Dark Sentio's Record, although neither do those Moon Elves. Actually, it's useless for me. I don't care about Dark Sentios at all. So, I need help from Telecaster this time. He would be better... no, he knows more about magic. So, take Dark Sentio's Record to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village.	This is a big favor from me, so you have to let him know about it. Take Dark Sentio's Record to Magic Trainer Castor southeast of the village.	A completely unexpected guest! And unexpected gifts, too! Oh, of course I know about the book. I know more about this book than anyone in the village. And about recent events, too. I was actualy nervous that Koop might do something rash, but he dealt with it wisely. Give me the book.

With the help of ancient sorcerers, we can open a tiny crack to talk to Evil Dark Hall, which exists between Dark Sentio and the World of the Elementals. We'll ask them to take this document back. We need fifteen pieces of Wolves' Fur to do so. You can get them using your Ransacking skill on the Direwolves near Grand Crimson.	Again, what we need are fifteen pieces of Wolf's Fur.

While I was out in the plain searching for materials, monsters attacked me out of nowhere. Usually, they can be spooked with a single spell and they run off, but this time they were quite determined. Maybe they were trying to get Dark Sentio's Record. I had it with me. I heard the Moon Elves first lost the book after being attacked by monsters. There's something going on... The necklaces the monsters had on really concern me. I am sure those are... I really need your help. I'll start the ceremony to bring out the Dark Hall, but I'm worried about monsters. Can you defeat the Frost Thieves south of the Wind Plains and get the Necklace of Darkness?	Remember that while you're thinking, the clock is ticking. Defeat Frost Thieves south of the Wind Plain and get the Necklace of Darkness.	Thanks to you, the ceremony ended in success and Dark Sentio's Record is gone now. So, what about you? See... I was right... This is called the Necklace of Darkness. It appears along with travelers in black robes.

He tries to unite my opponents and increase his power to usurp my position as the Security Chief, or Village Chief... Whatever...He wants control over this village. Such a plan is poison to this village. I'll send him a letter of warning. Can you run an errand for me? Deliver this Warning to Magic Trainer Castor southeast of the village.	What's the delay? Do you look down on me, too? Do you want to be kicked out of the village? If not, get busy. Deliver this Warning to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village.	Oh... What in the world is this? Hmmm. He's always been excessively paranoid and here it comes again. This isn't the first time he's done this. Never mind... I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm not maneuvering myself for anything.

The Mist Slasher symbolizes revenge to Orcs in the southern area. They give this as a token of revenge. Well, Castor isn't an Orc, but I'm sure he gave it to me with that intention. He would never just give me a present. How should I pay him back? Right... I'll give him a curse that is most fitting. You'll find a tombstone lying underneath a small pond north of Wind Plain. A Ring of Curses is hidden under the tombstone. Deliver the Ring of Curses to Magic Trainer Castor southeast of the village.	I know the ring exists, but I don't know the story behind it. You should find someone else to tell you about it. Please don't bother me anymore. Just get the Ring of Curses beneath a tombstone north of the Wind Plain and deliver it to Magic Trainer Castor southeast of the village.	This is what is known as a Ring of Curse, but that name is somewhat misleading. The tombstone commemorated a former Thief King in that region. Although he was a thief, he was a champion for the less fortunate and weak. After his death, his body was cremated and his followers buried his ring, placing a tombstone above it. When the great troops of Orcs swept across that area, they all protected that monument with their lives.																				165609585	2615	Ring of Curse	1																	1.

I feel like I should play a trick on him! Can you give me a hand? Koop hates me so much, but he can't do anything to me because I'm a sorcerer. He has great strength for sure, but is somewhat afraid of magic. This Ring of Curses seems to be a symbol of his nervousness about me. I'll make use of his fear.

Tell him it's a Ghost Thief talisman. He will just freak out. Hahaha...	Why a talisman from a Ghost Thief when just a normal talisman would do? Because there's a legend about them just like the one about the Thief King. Actually a Ghost Thief's Talisman just soothes the minds of those who leave their homes. But some travelers think they're cursed. So get the Ghost Thief's Talisman north of Dusty creek and give it to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village, telling him where it came from.	What is this talisman? What?

It's quite simple. In Shinewood they have a wonderful perfume, far better than any you have encountered. Merchant Girin of Ellore has it; she won't sell it to an outsider, but she might give it as a reward for a personal favor. I understand she has been having difficulties with the Centaur Windrunners northwest of Ellore in the Shinewood. The villagers don't want to cause trouble with the Centaurs, but if an Orc were to do it... well, that's a different matter. I'll bet Girin will be very grateful once you kill ten Centaur Windrunners. When you're finished, go northwest of the village to find her and tell her what you've done; then you can ask for the Fine Perfume.	Orcs are always the ones chosen for hard, gruelling work, so stop frowning and hunt down ten Centaur Windrunners northwest of Ellore in Shinewood. Then go to General Merchant Girin northwest of the town and ask her for the Perfume.	I heard there was an Orc fighting Centaur Windrunners and it was you! You're very courageous, but what are you fighting for? Oh, the perfume? Well, I never told Kuro I would give the perfume in exchange for Windrunners. I just said they were bothersome and nothing more. They're residents of Shinewood, too. Ah... But I can't let you go empty-handed when you've come all the way here. What should I do?

Delfaras merchants, who have the perfume, are staying at the Elder's house. But you can't buy it with gold because they only exchange goods. They don't sell them. So, I found out what they wanted. They want the hide of a monster. That's all they told me. They're probably afraid I might intercept it if they told me too much. They just told me that it's hidden somewhere in the display rack in Redderhood in Membreathen. Maybe the hunters left it when Spriggans raided the area. So, go get the Monster's Hide.	There's no other way you can trade with them. They're really picky, but sometimes even general merchants have to deal with them because they have goods others don't. Get the Monster's Hide in the display rack in Redderhood in Membreden.	They look just like other skins, but there must be a reason they want it so badly. We Merchants should be well-informed.

I thought it was just a rumor running through the taverns, but it was true. Centaur Scouts, expelled from the Human's Shinewood, did all these things! They were driven out of Shinewood for following the power of Dark Sentio and attacked the Moon Elves who were carrying Dark Sentio's Record. Well, that's not what matters. They are mistaken if they think they can get away with it while I'm here. So, destroy fifteen Centaur Scouts in Grand Crimson.	There's no time to delay! Go now, destroy fifteen Centaur Scouts in Grand Crimson.	I feel terrible that I was fooled by those idiots, but I'm in charge of this village. No one can belittle me. Ok.

Well, now that I know how, I feel like making one. The problem is, I don't have any Harpy Feathers. So, can you get some for me? I can never hunt those mysterious birds flying in the sky. Get me ten Harpy's Feathers. Use your Ransacking skill on the Harpies living at the southern end of the Wasteland.	I'm close to making my masterpiece, so please help me. Bring me ten Harpy's Feathers. You can get them using your Ransacking skill on the Harpies living in the southern end of Poppy field.	Aha... You brought it... How thankful I am...

So, can you run a simple errand for me? Just ask Blacksmith Falcon to make a firm, strong arrow shaft. Strong enough to survive strong winds or shock. I was told that a regular wooden shaft can't stand up to the power of Harpy Feathers. But he might be busy with other work and put off doing mine. So we need to encourage him with a present. He loves delicious mushrooms. With five Mushrooms, I think we can get him to do my work first. Buy Mushrooms from the cook and give them to Blacksmith Falcon at the center of the village. Don't forget to ask my favor.	Buy five Mushrooms from the cook and give them to Blacksmith Falcon at the center of the village, asking for my favor.	You have to wait a month, it's the busiest season.

But you know, if the metal is too hard the arrows will break every time, so let's see... I know the ideal material for the shaft you want, but the problem is... Heh, are you a good thief? Well, even if you're not, you have to be a thief this time to help Shakran. The ideal metal is Illuminite, harder than cast iron, but as light as a feather and as flexible as a willow branch. Only Gnomes know how to handle it, and there is only a little Illuminite around. You have to steal it from the wagon of a Gnome keeper in the Old Mine. And if you get caught, don't tell anyone I put you up to this.	Sometimes stealing others' things is inevitable. Come on, get Illuminite from the carriage wagon in the Old Mine.	Good.

But I suppose neither the dog, nor the dog's owner, is like that. Then I guess we should try to save the dog. I can make an Antidote. Only a wonderful Alchemist like me is capable of making it, although it only requires a few ingredients. I'll need several Desert Flowers to make the antidote, but you only brought one. I can go out and get more, but I need you to destroy ten Harpies at the southern end of the wasteland so I can gather Desert Flowers safely. Quality Desert Flowers only grow there.	What on earth are you doing? Don't you care about the dog's life? Well, if so, why should I be doing this? I have nothing to do with the dog. If you don't want to see Kobolt die, destroy ten Harpies at the southern end of the Wasteland.	It wasn't a hard job, but you're quite late. Don't waste my time like that!

North of Ellore and west of Shinewood there are some Rain Torges. They purify the rain water, transform it into Magic Spring Water and carry it inside their bodies. The Magic Spring Water can revive unhealthy plants. That's what I need now. I hope you can get it for me.	It's quite far, but a traveler like you can get there easily. Destroy Rain Torges north of Ellore, west of Shinewood and get the Magic Spring Water. This is the only solution.	You've done a great job traveling such a long distance.

It's to represent the two towns' friendship or something, but I'm intrigued as it's supposed to be really expensive. Maybe they were so worried about us that they are going to Trilgard along the north road via the seaside without passing through Zylok. But I can't just let them have their way. We need a really huge army, not a small one. I think we need help from the Guilds, so go to Guild Leader Jean Kiev and ask him for help. Of course, you can't go to him empty-handed. Bring ten Marylith's Scales. The Scales are of excellent use when decorating the guild marks. You can get them by using your Ransacking skill on the Marylith Countesses near the Wasteland.	Like I said, there's no need to talk now, just do what I asked. Go near the Wasteland, destroy Marylith Countess and bring back my Money Pouch.	Koop seems to be overzealous these days and now he's planning a nonsensical scheme. Do you think I'm crazy enough to lend the power of my guild for such a ridiculous thing? Guilds are quite corrupt these days, but they shouldn't be involved in plans to cause conflict with neighbors. Sadly, I can't just bluntly refuse Koop's request. It wouldn't help my position. Of course, I'll take that present anyway.			1105	Marylith's Scale	10																																			1. Get ten Marylith's Scales.	11	2.

I'll trick Koop this time. Go tell him I'll accept his request only when he shows a certain level of effort, like dispatching a minimum number of mercenaries. He'll do it, to show his good faith, but I'll install a magical trap there in advance. Koop will suffer, but won't die. He won't be able to move. Then the convoy will pass through the area safely. I think this plan will work, but it will take a while to make the trap, so I need your help. Go near Wind Vally. If you destroy ten Frost Thieves, it will be much easier. After that, go to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village and tell him what I told you to say.	I know you're with him only because you can't disobey him, right? But you should be able to tell right from wrong. Hurry. Destroy ten Frost Thieves near the Wind Plain and help me work. Then, go to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village and deliver my message.	Oh, you're back! What did he say? Hmm... He wants his mercenaries take the lead? Well, that's no problem. I'll use this opportunity to show who's the most powerful around here. Let's gather the troops. Anyway, thank you.						338	Frost Thief	10																																1.

I'll show them the power of professional mercenaries. But can you do me a favor? I heard that Magic Armor Merchant Quentin recently found some delicious honey. I want that honey, but he refused to sell it at any price. So, the only way to get it is to steal it or take it from him by force. The latter would tarnish my reputation, so I need you to steal the Honey Pot from him. Quentin hid the Honey Pot inside a vase on the north side of the village. Search for the vase and bring me the Honey Pot.	Why do you delay? Are you afraid you might get caught? Well, I guess you're not so daring, after all. Getting caught is okay. You can just run away or apologize. Easy. So, go now! There's a vase with the Honey Pot inside that Quentin hid north of the village. Search for the jar and bring me the Honey Pot.	What!

Other Sorcerers I consulted are completely at a loss. There's only one person who can solve this problem, and that would be Castor. Go to Magic Trainer Castor southeast of the village, and ask him about these symptoms.	Why are you so lazy? You're going to be in trouble once I recover. Go to Magic Trainer Castor southwest of the village and ask for help!	It's an emergency. I can see it on your face. Hmm... From his symptons, I can tell this is ancient magic. It's a spell. Of course, Koop's sorcerers can't solve it. But, who would have done such a thing? Sorcerers from the Human land are not likely to have done these things... I should research it some more.

I thought there were only two people capable of such a spell in this village, me and my pupil Jean Kiev. Solution? Of course, there's one. The ancient spells are more like a vicious intention than true magic, so it can be solved in a very natural way. If you go hunt Fountain Lamias west of the Dusty Creek, you can get Black Body Fluids with a little luck. Give it to the Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village and tell him to drink it. The fluids will work straight away.	No one knows why Lamias have Black Body Fluids, but it's the only antidote against this spell. If it works, he'll give orders to his soldiers or something. Come on, get Fountain Lamia's Black Body Fluids from the Lamias west of Dusty Creek and take it to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village. Make him drink it.	What... What's this? You want me to drink this horrible stuff? An antidote? Eew... I don't trust Telecaster, but I'll drink it because you're here. If it kills me, you should get rid of Telecaster right away, okay? Hmm... Wow... I actually feel better... My pains are disappearing...  Unbelievable! This stuff really works! I'll tell my soldiers. Unfortunately, while we were lying in bed the convoy passed us by. My plan failed! I've got to move on to the next opportunity.

Actually, we've discovered Seena's Vase was stolen by a Windwing Harpy. That means what Scar said was wrong. Ha! How could a mercenary prevent a thief that just flew away? I'm sorry. Anyway, that means there's one thing left to do. Destroy Windwing Harpies in the Wasteland, retrieve the Ancient Vase and deliver it to the Item Trader Seena east of the village.	Let bygones be bygones! Let's not blame Scar. Destroy the Windwing Harpies in the Wasteland, retrieve the Ancient Vase and deliver it to Item Trader Seena east of the village.	This is it! It was so hard to retrieve my vase... Stupid mercenaries. I actually found out it was Windwing Harpy who stole it. I asked around and some merchants from the west said they saw Windwing Harpy. So, I told the mercenaries and they found it eventually, with help from you. Anyway, I'm relieved you brought it back. Thank you very much. Next time, I'll just ask you, not the mercenaries.			2568	Ancient Vase	1	320	Windwing Harpy		2568	Ancient Vase	30	1																												1.

Huh, but don't you think it's interesting that this corps is to chase the missing Usus? You do know there's a huge reward placed on it. So, I'm joining the Trilgard Adventurer Corps. But they're asking a fee for participation. Actually, I don't want to be bothered by that, so can you help me? What I need to give... are ten pieces of Venison. Can you deliver them to Adventurer Tarisild north of Trilgard Square? Use your Meat Carving skill on the Blade Bucks appearing in the Village of Rest in Ezerock to get the Venison.	Just do this for me this time, please. Get ten pieces of Venison using your Meat Carving skill on the Blade Bucks in the Village of Rest in Ezerock. Then give them to Adventurer Tarisild north of Trilgard Square.	Ah, a rookie. Give me the Venison. Oh, you're not entering yourself? It's ok. Just tell me the entrant's name. Um... Is he the Kaneios living in Zylok?  Hm... Well... Why... No, no. It's nothing. Just wait a second.			730	Venison	10																																			1. Get ten pieces of Venison.	11	2.

1007	Adventurer Corps	Rigid Chest	Trilgard; Tarisild	1		47				2	1006	Gathering Adventurers	<Adventurer> Tarisild	<Traveler> Kaneios				I heard all the rumors about Kaneios. I heard he is quite dangerous. I don't mean it in a bad way. He's dangerous not because he is cruel or ruthless, but because he always attracts trouble wherever he goes. Many travelers don't like to work with him. It's a surprise that you didn't know that as you are a traveler yourself. But I don't want to be rejecting an entrant without a good reason. So, let's just do it like this. I once found the Rigid Chest at some ruins with some travelers. We tried our best to open it but we all failed. On top of that, it was too heavy to move, so we just left it there. The location is the well southwest of the Blood Shelter and the chest is inside the well. Deliver that Rigid Chest to traveler Kaneiosis south of Zylok and tell him he'll be accepted if he opens it.	I know this is rather mean, but if Kaneios is as they say, he should fall for it. He's rather ...dim. Hmm, anyway. Get the Rigid Chest from a well southwest of the Blood Shelter and deliver it to traveler Kaneios, south of Zylok.	So, how did it go? What's this chest? Right... So, what should I do? Open the chest? But what's inside? You don't know? OK. You just brought it. Wait there while I try.																				159056065	2580	Rigid Chest	1																	1.

My mighty power will impress them, won't it? Well, I guess others could've opened a chest like this, too. Maybe I need to earn some more points. Travelers sometimes need to be wise to survive. I heard Adventurer Tarisild's hobby is collecting Crossbows. That means five Wood Crossbows would be good. Get five Wood Crossbows and take them to Adventurer Tarisild north of Trilgard Square.	There are other competitors, so you have to hurry. Otherwise, the entry period might end. So, quickly get five Wood Crossbows and take them to Adventurer Tarisild north of Trilgard Square.	What? This is nonsense. I heard he was odd, but never imagined a bribe like this. Why bribe someone to enter an Adventurer Corps? Well since you've already delivered it I'll accept it, but I promise I'll distribute them to other adventurers so this isn't a bribe. I won't accept Kaneios. He's given me so many problems.			34	Wood Crossbow	5																																			1. Get five Wood Crossbows.	11	2.

1012	Hidden Flame	Falcon's Mistake	Zylok; Falcon	1		47				2			<Blacksmith> Falcon	<Miner> Pickin Firepick				I made such a horrible mistake! I broke Warrior Weapons Merchant Skita's Axe by mistake. That axe has been in his family for generations. If Skita notices this, I'm as good as dead. But I'm a professional, so I can't just do nothing. I decided to make a replacement. With our unique traditional way, I think I have one chance to recreate the axe. But I need a Blazing Crystal, which is extremely hard to get. At least in Ezerock and Grimlore. So, it looks like you'll have to go a long way to get it. If you go to the Limelight area, west of the place where the Humans live, there is a place called Gnome's Cave. Go there and you will meet Miner Picken Firepick. He might be able to supply it.	It's going to be a really long journey, so there's no time to waste. Go to Miner Pickin Firepick at the Gnome Cave in the Limelight area and ask about the Blazing Crystal.	You've come all the way here and I have nothing to serve to you. Please accept my apologies. Tell me, how is Balo... no, Falcon doing? We haven't corresponded for so long. By the way, why are you here? Blazing Crystal! oh.... Is that what he's looking for? Yeah, it's a Fire Elemental Stone that's been buried underground for a long time. It soaks up the power of the Land Elemental for so long it can't be used as a proper Elemental Stone, but it produces flames forever, so it's very useful for anything needing to be processed in fire for a long time. They're so rare, they're very hard to get. I don't have one right now but I'll try to get one. I've heard rumors about one recently somewhere...																																								1.

Honestly, its quality is less than I expected. There are some old ruins in Scout's Land and Goblins are living there now. The Crystal of Blaze is inside a torch over there. I don't know how the Goblins got it, but it shouldn't be a problem to take it back. Get it and go to Blacksmith Falcon at the center of Zylok. I'm sure he's desperately awaiting it because he's in trouble.	I wish the Goblins hadn't gotten their grubby hands on it at all, but that's not the point here. Get the Blazing Crystal from a torch in Scout's Land and go to Blacksmith Falcon at the center of Zylok.	Right, I do have a knack for recognizing skilled travelers. I had faith you would bring it. Well, Pickin helped of course, but thank you anyway. So, we've got at least one of the components, but we're far from done.

You can't just come and go as you please. To live in this village, everyone has to prove their talent. We usually test new-comers when they first come here, but one test is not enough. It's nonsense to imagine that you can stay here forever only after going through one test, don't you think? Everyone has to show that their talents are still intact as time goes by. It's no different for all travelers like you. You wonder why? That's the rule I established to keep the peace in this town. If you don't want to follow that rule, just leave! Hmm... You want to stay here, right? Then I'll test you. It's simple. Bring me twelve Small Healing Potions.	Lazy people in this village are fined, then expelled. That goes for you, too.

This is why I want you to destroy five Harpy Airwalkers south of Grand Crimson. How can I get rid of them all? I just want to let them know that I mean business. Meanwhile, I'll go and eat my birthday dinner.	Don't just stand there. Destroy five Harpy Airwalkers south of Grand Crimson. We should help each other out. Afterall, today is my birthday.	Wow. This is really yummy. I'm savoring this delicious dinner. I wish my birthday was every day. Of course, I know that you've done your best.

All of his belongings were gone. I guess thieves or mercenaries stole it all. How can they be so heartless? My friend must have known the rules of the desert because he wrote his will on his palm. Thank heavens, I could read it. The will said I hid a surprising treasure. Make sure it doesn't fall into the hands of the greedy. I hope you can bring it to me. Get the Scroll of Power from a gravestone east of Grand Crimson.	Koop is always scheming, so try not to get caught by him. Bring the Scroll of Power from a gravestone east of Grand Crimson.	Well, it's just a normal looking scroll. But I'm sure it has some special quality, judging by my friend's will. Maybe I should ask Castor.

However, it comes at the highest price - destruction of all in the end. He ordered me to bring three things because the scroll can be sealed, although it's impossible to destroy it because of its tremendous magical power. Before you do anything else, get three Bone Staffs and give them to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village.	All magic has its own meaning. Three Bone Staffs, he said, work as three flags to suppress the power. To be honest, I don't really know what that means! But hurry up and get three Bone Staffs and give them to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village.	Welcome. You're helping Quentin, right? I'm relieved there's a courageous traveler to help in this quest. Give me the Staffs. Thank you. Oh, don't leave yet.

The offering isn't meat. I need ten Centaurs' Horns. You can get them by destroying the Centaur Scouts in the Salarmis Garden and using your Ransacking skill on them.	It's time for you to blood your weapon. There are Thunder Griffins near Grand Crimson. Destroy ten of them with your own weapon and come to me for an oath of blood.	Thank you.

Of course, some greedy people only seek Silver Nuggets for the monetary value. Ironically, the purest silver can be found inside the body of Mobet Lord Warzakh, south of Milieu. Mobet Lords swallow silver for its magical power. So, please help us. Destroy Warzakh and retrieve the Silver Nugget. Without that, all of our efforts will have been in vain.	We need to get this back at all costs. Destroy the Mobet Lord Warzakh south of Milieu and retrieve the Silver Nugget.	You're wounded all over... But you did bring the Silver Nugget! Amazing. I'm sure you're under the protection of the Elementals! From now on, the Scroll of Power will be sealed, but I can't keep it forever. I'll just wait until I can hide it in a secluded place.

I was told that there is a slate with the Structural Map of the Climate Map attached to a Stone Pillar south of the Curse Vally in Bigoror. They say a Moon Elf adventurer made it. For whatever purpose it was made, it could be a lifesaver for us. So, get that Structural Map of the Climate Map. Mind you, you have to be extremely careful, as that is the only one in the world.	Find the Structural Map of Milieu attached to a slate at the Stone Pillar south of Curse Valley. There is no other option.	Thank you. It may not be fatal, but you've been injured quite a bit.

He kept total control of those spears, so he was the only one who could control the Climate Map. I've known the location of the spears a long time, but I never knew their value. They've been kept in the Harpies' Treasure House. Have you heard about it? It's been underground a long time and the Harpies keep the key. So, your goal is clear.

This village is being controlled by Koop's mercenaries, and I don't want any trouble with them. This needs to be resolved through dialogue. So, can you go talk to Mercenary Ska in front of the north gate of the village? We haven't been getting along so I can't talk with Ska directly.	Well, we used to have good times together, but when I last saw Ska, it was really miserable. I'm sorry, but go and ask Mercenary Ska in front of the north gate of the village.	What? Skita? I don't want to see him either. I don't like the fact that we were both mercenaries for a while. I don't know what Skita said, but we had to kidnap his friend's daughter because his friend stole our war funds, so we have to get the money back somehow. Will I release the daughter if the money is returned? I can't say right now. You're not her father, are you?																																								1.

He's now hiding in Ivory Grave Village, so destroy ten Vampire Magicians around there and open the way for me.	I met him finally, but he betrayed me.

Their headquarters is located on Ever-Snowy Mountain. Not everyone can access the mountain, but there's also a building in Tullan for Elders' meetings, and I think we can find the shield there. You will see a building, north of Tullan, with boxes scattered around it. It looks shabby from outside, but is a warehouse full of all kinds of materials, all an elaborate ruse. Search those boxes and find the Heaven Covering Shield. Deliver it to traveler Dag at the center of the village and your job is done.	The Heaven Covering Shield is said to have the power to dispel clouds that hang over Millieu. Some say the shield was part of Millieu originally. Anyway, find the Heaven Covering Shield from the boxes in the building north of Tullan. Give it to traveler Dag at the center of the village.	This is the Shield.

I've just been neglecting my appearance lately. Hmm... I'm saying this because I want to pay a bit of attention to my looks. Recently I met someone I fancy. I won't tell you who he is. Just know there is one. I've decided I want to improve the way I look from now on, but Zylok is such a small village, receiving help from a neighbor usually means widespread rumors. Therefore, I want you to go to Stylist Domion on the east side of Trilgard and deliver my message. Don't go empty-handed. Bring a Knowledge Ring. She doesn't work for free.	Don't forget you'll have a hard time in Zylok unless you help me. Keep that in mind. Get a Knowledge Ring and go to Beauty Artist Domion east of Trilgard.	Well, a citizen of Zylok can easily go to other beauty artists in the village. It's not that I mind it, but mercenaries have far worse skin than travelers like you. Even the ancient therapies can't promise quick improvement. And it's harder to erase scars from battle. But what can I do? I can't ignore clients.

The best and quickest way is to make a lotion for her. I need some special ingredients to purify her troubled skin. Usually, trees in cold regions produce good water for whitening, and there is one tree that generates the best whitening solution in Grimlore. It's the sap of the tree we call the Pure White Water. Bring the Pure White Water from a tree south of Crowcross in Grimlore. That can soften Ska's skin.	You can't just get as much sap as you want any time. We're going to great effort to keep that tree alive, so you have to hurry. Otherwise, you won't have a chance. Bring me the Pure White Water from a tree south of Crowcross in Grimlore.	Good job.

This is why I changed my mind to show him my true abilities not my beautiful face. Now my target is Harpy Queen Sizel in the Poppy Field. You should go with me.

Get the Pendant of Blood from the Euriale Soldiers and take it to Alchemist Deathnote at the center of Zylok.	That Pendant is my friend's. Why do you have it? Hmm, then the rumors must be true.

Even if I fail, I must at least try. I need some ingredients. Bring me twenty Troll's Eyes. Use your Ransacking skill on the Rodam Crushers of Village of Seethe to get them.	There are several ways to get Trolls' Eyes, but I recommend you use your Ransacking skill on the Rodam Crushers at Seethe Village.  Bring them to me when you're done.

Unfortunately, the monsters took it for their own use, which means my friend's soul will be sucked into one of the monsters. We can't allow that. Go to Vampire Village, defeat the Vampire Knights and bring it back!	I hope it's not too late. Go to Vampire Village, defeat the Vampire Knights and bring back the Coffin of Resurrection.	Let's see. Hmm... It ended in failure. The coffin has been damaged and can no longer be used. I wasn't expecting too much, but...

I don't trust Security Chief Koop and the mercenaries... they're always looking after their own interests. So I have no choice but to take care of it myself.  Magic Trainer Castor, southeast of the village, is the only one I trust. Go see him and ask him to solve this problem.	I know this is asking a lot, but can you at least ask him? Go to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village and tell him about my idea.	Haha. I thought only young children asked such naive questions. I guess Basil thinks like one. We can't even control one bit of soil or blade of grass in Chantra So think about how difficult it would be to control a whole area.

3039	Attack of the Pagans	Attacked Dag	Zylok; Koop	1		53				2			<Security Chief> Koop	<Traveler> Dag				Recently, the Traveler Dag went to the Village of Seeth and was badly injured. He was left in Syllancium and discovered by mercenaries.  Honestly, one or two hurt travelers isn't a big deal, but I'm worried about this incident because we found a Pagan Pattern painted on his body. I despise anyone who upsets the order of this village, and that includes Pagans! But things are progressing slowly because some of the mercenaries are very superstitious. I'd like you to help. Go to the Traveler Dag in the center of the village and listen to what he says about the situation in detail.	Find out about the specifics from Traveler Dag at the center of the village. I'm too busy to worry about such matters.	I... I'm scared. I don't even want to think about what happened. Just leave me alone for a while. I'll talk when it's time. You... you're trusthworthy, but I can't help but be scared. I'm sorry. Give me some time.																																								1.

As you know the Village of Seethe is empty. Well, I visited the village on a very personal issue and fell asleep in the shade. Then suddenly, men in black masks showed up. They were really scary. They started chanting some spell and my body was frozen. I couldn't move. Then they wrote something weird on my body with dye. How did I escape? Monsters attacked. I can't really remember.  Anyway, they were eaten by the monsters. I almost got eaten as well, but managed to escape in time. I don't know who they were. Evidence?  There is none. But the monsters ate them, so maybe you could find something out if you cut open the monsters. The Young Turkavens in the Village of Seethe ate them. You might be able to obtain find one of the Necklaces the men in masks were wearing. Take it to Security Chief Koop in front of the West gate of the village.	Destroy the Young Turkavens in the Village of Seeth and get the Necklace. It might be a useful piece of evidence for Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village.	Did you find out about Dag? Hmm. This is a necklace the followers of Baramundo wear. Looks like the Pagans are behind this. I don't care. Pagan or no Pagan, I'll kill anyone who threatens my authority. I'll investigate this incident further.			3412	Necklace of Incantation	1	902	Satyros Guardian		3412	Necklace of Incantation	15	1																												1.

I roughed them up a bit and got some information. They talked about a plan to build a powerful base of support in Silancium.  Sounds to me like they're going to damage our village. They've been posting a Propagation Statement all over the place. I need one. I understand there are still several left on the rocks in the Village of Seethe. Bring me the Propagation Statement. I trust you'll do it for me.	Bring me the Propagation Statement from the rocks in Slash-and-Burn Village and make sure no one sees you!	Let's see. Hmm, how arrogant. What should I do with them?

There's a guy I know who's asking for money in return for information on the headquarters of the Baramundu religion. How could he do that to a friend? Anyway, we need to take down their headquarters, so I'll give in this time. But next time he asks for money...  Anyway, bring me ten thousand Gold so I can pay him.	Well, you don't have to get me the money. But that might make it hard for you to stay in this village. Considering that, it would be wise to get the money, wouldn't it? So do whatever you have to do to get the ten thousand Gold.	Hm, that was quick.  What a pushover.  I would've asked for more.  Please wait.		10000																																						1.

We barely managed to fortify our front line, but we can't go on like this. We need your help. I'm thinking of a surprise attack. Take down forty Rodam Breakers in Ivory Grave Village. Take them by surprise. The mercenaries will follow. Go on!	Now, don't worry. Destroy forty Rodam Breakers in Ivory Grave Village and surprise them. The mercenaries will follow.	We almost had them.

You were passing by, so you must hear me out. Do you know anything about the riddles of Vampire Prince Shocker? You don't? Shocker likes riddles and presents riddles to travelers who pass by. If they get the right answer, they get to pass. Even if they don't, they get to pass, but in the latter case, they have to figure out the correct answer before nightfall or they will die that night. Don't give me that look. I was presented with a riddle by Shocker! What was the riddle? This is what he said, It brings death during sleep, but is the friend of deer when awake. What is it?  You don't know, do you? Oh dear. I guess I'll have to get someone else's help. Warrior Armor Merchant Peabay, on the north of the village, is great with riddles. He might know the answer.  Hurry and go ask him.	Warrior Armor Merchant Peabay, who's north of the village, is good at riddles. Go ask him.	Riddles?  I do love them.  What's the riddle?

It uses its toxic gas to kill all animals that approach it at night. But during the day, it's simply a plant that deer like to eat. Pretty easy for those of us who like riddles.  Anyway, Deathnote didn't know it. Well, I also heard that Shocker only accepts the answer if the actual item is brought to him. So you will have to find Sandragora. You can find it among the roots of shrubs near Glitters at the West end of Silancium. Find the Sandragora and take it to Alchemist Deathnote at the center of the village.	This means we have solved the puzzle, not Deathnote. But... Well anyway, find Sandragora among the shrub roots near Glitters.  Then take it to Alchemist Deathnote at the center of the village.

They talk about a rule called 'Equivalence Exchange.' In order to become an Archlord, they say you must give up something of equal value. My foolish little brother was duped and gave them our family armor that's been handed down for generations. I don't even know who they are, so I have no idea how to find them. I think I'll need the help of Archer Trainer Moto at the southeast end of the village. Take thirty-five Troll's Hides to him. We can't ask his help for free, can we? Whether you buy them or use your Skinning skills on the Rodam Breakers south of Vampire Village, I don't care.	If I were you, I'd use your Skinning skills on the Rodam Breakers in Vampire Village to get the hides. There's no need to spend money when you have the skills.

Rumor has it that an immortal god lives there. I think it's simply a fairy tale. Unfortunately, some people believe stories like that. Not long ago, Traveler Dag said he saw the Grim Reaper and is now worried he's going to die. Even if something doesn't exist, if you believe in it enough, you can make it happen. Frankly, I'm not concerned about matters of death and life, but those around him say he needs medicine. There's nothing as difficult as dealing with something that doesn't exist, but what choice do I have but to do as everyone wishes? Bring me twenty-five Ghoul's Fangs.

If someone approaches the area with less than holy purposes, it displays frightening illusions, chasing the intruder away. What Dag saw must've been one of those illusions. The stone tablet mentions a way to cancel this magic, so I assume the one who cast the spell isn't the one who made the stone tablet.

Did you know Security Chief Koop really hates Usus? They used to know each other. But after Usus attacked Tullan and became famous, Koop started to disdain him. I guess you could say he's jealous of Usus. Anyway, that's why he likes to get information on Usus. He thinks it will bring him closer to taking Usus down! I've heard the followers of Usus are planning a conspiracy in Ivory Grave Village. Take this Letter and deliver it to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village. You must tell him it's from me!	I asked you to take this Letter to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village.	What's this? Kuro sent me a letter?

They're mortified to have lost so badly to monsters. I'd like you to become a mercenary for one day and avenge them. Your job is to destroy forty Raid Brans in The Span.	Now, don't be too nonchalant. Get a move on. Go destroy forty Raid Brans in The Span. Now!	Good job, but for some reason I still feel like something's wrong. We should've done it ourselves, I guess.

He's done nothing wrong, but they're chasing him nonetheless. He's in hiding now. I'm sure the mercenaries won't be able to find him. But he can't live like that forever. I must talk to the mercenaries. Whether it's because of something he did or something the mercenaries did, there must be a reason for their hunt. Get twenty Roundtrip Passports and go to Mercenary Scar in front of the north gate of the village.	Roundtrip Passports are very important to mercenaries. They help them escape from whatever battle they might find themselves in. Get twenty Roundtrip Passports and go to Mercenary Scar in front of the north gate of the village.	Oh, my. I was frustrated by that incident, but to hear it's Barrakas' friend is worse. It doesn't change anything, though. Things like that don't matter to mercenaries. But... hmm.

He tricked the mercenaries by saying he had the Archons and extorted their money. Then when they found out it was a lie, he ran away. Yes, you could say it's the mercenaries' fault for being tricked in the first place, but what about the way he used them and kept them from doing their work? If Koop finds out, things will get worse. What can you do to help? Well, if you take care of these tasks, I'll consider it. Good. You must be brave to work for someone you don't even know. Your first task is to destroy forty Lamia Witches in the Death Plains. The mercenaries should've done this a month ago.	Are you trying to back out already? Then you won't be able to help Balakas.

Mercenaries turn into thieves when they can't get what they need. My job is to stop that from happening, but things look very bad right now. They've been busy because of the Archons, so the warehouse has been empty for almost a month. At this rate, an uprising will happen. But of course, the young fellows don't think it's their fault. It'll be too late if we wait for them to realize what they've done. So you must fill the warehouse for us. Bring in twenty-five slabs of Hawk Meat. You can get them using your Meat Carving skill on the Young Hawkarrows on the Hawks' Plateau.	Hawk meat is a very valuable emergency ration because it enhances physical strength and endurance. So Go to the Hawks' Plateau, use your Meat Carving skill on the Young Hawkarrows and get twenty-five slabs of Hawk Meat.	I think we've pretty much completed the basic preparations.

Of course, Balakas' friend didn't kill him, but he did die while on the chase. The dead fellow's name was Zarkas. In order to calm the mercenaries down again, they'll want Balakas' friend dead, but then all your efforts would go to waste, so I've been acting as a mediator. To mercenaries, weapons are like their own children, but when Zarkas died, his weapon disappeared as well. He was killed by Robatoms in the Death Plains. Get Zarkas' Sword from them.	This is the most important task right now. Go to Death Plain and retrieve Zarkas' Sword from the Robatoms.	This is definitely Zarkas' Sword. I may be able to persuade them with this.

Hurry up before it's too late. Go to Archer Armor Merchant Balakas northwest of the village.	Hmm, thank goodness.

I don't know who their leader is, but I hear the monsters are following a strategy just like trained soldiers. The mercenaries are scared of them. Recently, Trilgard's nobleman Turgarb lost an Albileon to monsters in the process of importing it from Moon Elves. He's put out a big reward for the one who finds his Albileon, but no one has stepped foward, yet, because the monsters are so ferocious. I personally know Turgarb, so I can't ignore his pain. Isn't this what you've been training yourself for? Yes, that's the spirit. Anything is possible! So go to the Nobleman Turgarb near the South gate of Trilgard and find out about this incident.  Good luck!	I hope we're not causing more trouble by butting into other people's business. Well, you've offered to help. So go to the Nobleman Trugarb at the south gate near Trilgard.

Are you saying it's wrong for me to treasure it? Well, now I know where it is, and I plan to carry out a rescue operation. Since you came to help me, here's your task. Destroy thirty Redflag Sentries east of the Grim Reaper's Plains and clear a path.	What are you doing? Go destroy thirty Redflag Sentries east of the Death Plains.

Vellazuella flowers unfortunately don't grow in Silancium, cold Ezerock or Grimlore. They're abundant in Shinewood, which is why they have the best honey.  I've already asked Cook Setin in the south of Ellore, to gather the honey when it's time. She agreed to, if I bring her twenty-five Wind Stems. Wind Stems are only found in the land of Moon Elves.

So use your Ransacking skill on the Raid Brans in The Span to collect thirty Barrick's Entrails.	You need good bait to catch them.

Go to the Hawks' Plateau and destroy thirty Ancient Ghouls.	It's a little difficult, but I think you'll do well. Go to the Hawks' Plateau and kill thirty Ancient Ghouls.

She hurt herself trying to hunt the moles. I shouldn't accept these even if she did fail, but then again I don't want to be rude. Thank you. I'll have to thank Felicia when I have time.

3100	Big Statue's Belt	Skin from the Desert	Zylok; Deathnote	1		56				2			<Alchemist> Deathnote	<Mercenary> Scar				Have you heard the story about the Big Statue of Tantlas? A long time ago, Silancium was ruled by the King of the Salam Kingdom. He built a big statue symbolizing the national strength of Salam. They called this the Big Statue of Tantlas. But as you can see, the statue is nowhere to be found. Relics from back then are found now and again deep in the ground of Silancium and are sold at very high prices. Recently, Mercenary Scar said he found a piece of leather in the desert that might be Tantlas' Belt. Tantlas' Belt is legendary because there are records that say 'it displays different qualities according to season based on alchemic principles.' If the piece of leather is really Tantlas' Belt, then it's quite exciting. Can you ask him if I could see it? He won't even talk to you if you go emptyhanded, so find five Wurt Zweihanders and take them with you. He collects weapons, so he should be impressed. Don't forget to ask him if he can show me the piece of leather.	They may not be enough, but we have no choice. Take five Wurt Zweihanders to Mercenary Scar in front of the north gate of the village and ask him for the piece of leather.	Deathnote sent you, hmm? Well, the piece of leather doesn't mean much to me so I could just give it to you, but since it's valuable to him, I would appreciate it if you offered me something for it.			520	Brut Zweihander	5																																			1.

He says he wants to take care of the recent conflict among monsters in Silancium and has requested my help.  But as an Orc and as a security chief, I can't do that. I actually want to interfere with the Humans' operations, but I want to do it covertly and plan to order the Guild Registrars to have the Guilds help me. Go to Guild Registrar Jean Kiev in the center of the village and tell him my wishes.	Well, I suspect Jean Kiev won't comply with my wishes easily, but go to Guild Registrar Jean Kiev in the center of the village and tell him my intentions anyway.	What's Koop up to? I know it's not easy joining forces with another tribe, but the monsters have caused us all great harm. I'll have to think about this.																																								1.

I'll handle Koop, so let's go on with what we had in mind. I heard Skita helped the Humans this time. It might be a good idea to give him more evidence, making Humans more willing to battle the monsters. I hear the Ancient Relics of the Salam Kingdom are involved in this incident. I think it's important to retrieve all of them. According to what I heard, the Redflag Raiders on the Hawks' Plateau carry around items called the Crest of the Salam Kingdom. Whenever the Salam Kingdom went to war, they used this magical crest on their flags. It's supposed to make anyone standing under it fearless. I'm sure the monsters don't know about this, but it's still dangerous for them to remain in their hands. So, please find the five Crests they're carrying around and deliver them to Warrior Weapons Merchant Skita north of the village!	Don't be lazy. Get moving! Go to the Hawks' Plateau and find the five Crests of the Salam Kingdom. The Redflag Raiders have them. Then go to Warrior Weapons Merchant Skita north of the village!	Oh, my. I was actually wondering what to do after hearing about the Crests. Thank you. But how did you know to bring these to me? That's just like Jean Kiev. I think it would be in everyone's best interest to do so. I have another favor to ask, so don't leave.

I understand there's a Staff of Healing on a tree northeast of the Hawks' Plateau. With that, the monsters can treat their wounds, which would be a problem for us if we plan to defeat them.

Riski, a Lamia Queen, is the one who was the most interested in the relics. It seems she was angry because she lost what's called a Supreme Ring to Humans, but now that she's lost the other relics as well, she's furious. I sent one of my men to follow the envoys of Ellore just in case. Well, he reported back to me and said Riski has set off looking for them. As a result, they've hidden themselves in a cave in Syllancium and are awaiting help. I think you're more suitable for such a task, so please help us.

I heard it in passing when I went to Battle Square a while ago. I personally hate sorceresses, so it didn't make much of an impression on me at the time. I'm just not too interested in what she did at Battle Square. But I just don't like sorceresses running wild. And I've heard she was seen in Silancium following a traveler in a black robe, with a trail of monsters in her wake. It's been chaos for the merchants. I sent some of my mercenaries to take care of the monsters, but they got in over their heads. To make things worse, most of my forces have gone to Kuhn because of the recent incident there, so I can't send any backup... except you. Go destroy thirty Golems near Hawks Plateau and help the mercenaries escape. That's an order.	We wouldn't have been embarrassed this way if we had the best mercenaries.

Like I said before, I'm sure there's a reason they're being so persistent.  Destroy twenty-five Golems south of the Desert Boundaries and help me scout. I can only do it if you help me.

Make sure you don't get caught by the monsters! Bring me the Silvery Box from under the rock in the Wanderers' Plain.	You found it! I wonder what it is... Oh, this is the Magic Box.

He was putting a talisman on a rock near the lake inside the village. Then he caught me and read a magic scroll and put a curse on me! Because of that curse, I haven't been making any money lately. He called it the 'Beggar's Curse.' Anyway, that's what happened. He said I would get in trouble if I told anyone about it before he finished his 'task' and I believe him. What task? I don't know. That's all I saw. Well, now I've told you everything, you've got to help me. Go to Magic Trainer Telecaster, southeast of the village, and see what he can do.	I fear I may have told you too much.

You're not here to buy merchandise? What are you saying? Why would I? Oh, I was wondering who took the talisman. It was you. Yes, I put it there. It wasn't to harm anyone. My only intention was to sell water.  Oh, don't look at me like that. I only have one rule I live by. Do what's profitable for me! That's it. I've been going through some tough times lately with this slump in my business.

They started coming after 'that day.'  I don't know if headaches are also considered a disease, but once they start, they last for hours. I don't tell such things to other people, but I think I can trust you. A few years ago, I was kidnapped during my travels. I don't remember who kidnapped me or for what reason. I only remember an obscure image as if someone erased my memory. Maybe I know something they don't want revealed. I also lost a bag at that time. Recently, Kaneios said he got a small bag in Silancium. I'm thinking it might be mine. I want to get it back, but he's asking an outrageous price for it. I'm sorry, but I'd like you to act as a mediator. Go to Traveler Kaneios south of the village, and talk to him.	He's known to be a very impatient and rough traveler. Not a pleasant fellow, but I'm in an urgent situation so go to Traveler Kaneios south of the village, and tell him my story.	So Felicia sent you, eh? Hmm, she's always thought little of me. So there's no reason I should help or cooperate, is there? So that's that.																																								1.

Well, there's no point swearing at me. You know life is just like that for travelers like us. You should know that, being a traveler yourself. I'm just wanting you to bring me what I need. A few days ago, I found a dead merchant in Wanderer Plain. I swear, I didn't kill him. But I thought Monsters would take all of his belongings. To prevent that, I collected his things. He had forty emeralds. One emerald was very large indeed. Unfortunately, some monsters chased me and took the jewels away from me. The monsters were Redflag Ironclad Soldiers. Do you get the picture? Good,  go catch the Soldiers and bring all the Emeralds back!	What I want you to do is very simple. First, defeat the Redflag Ironclad Soldiers. Then, look for forty Emeralds.	Give me the Emeralds.

Could you look for the Copy of the Document near the rocks east of the Wanderer Plains?	Each time I touch a page, I can feel another piece of memory come back to my mind through my fingertips. Ah, I can remember why I was kidnapped and who kidnapped me. They must have been Dark Sentio's followers. They tried to steal the Document from me. I was afraid of that and I made a copy. This is written with Dark Characters so I can't read it now, but I would have known how to read it at that time. Maybe the followers erased everything. I will certainly learn how to read them again and regain my lost memories. I'll bring back what I saw and heard when I was kidnapped. If the opportunity comes to me, would you please help me?

Do you know about him? He was one of the greatest mercenaries ever. His whereabouts haven't been known since the last battle with the Golems. At least now we know he's dead. I recognize this scar on his head. Did you find his axe near his ashes? I'm talking about 'Leinwurt.' It was reknowned for its ability to split anything. You know, a mercenary values his weapon as much as himself. There's even a saying, to truly honor a dead mercenary, have a funeral for his weapon. We have to find 'Leinwurt' to pay our respects to this fine mercenary. The only clue we have would be these ashes. Take them to Magic Trainer Telecaster, southeast of the village, and ask him what he can learn about the Axe.	If Security Chief Koop knows about it, he won't like it. Magic Trainer Telecastor, just southeast of the village, is the only sorcerer we can trust. Take these Ashes to him and ask him where the Axe is.	Recently, I've heard of people finding the ashes of mercenaries all around the village. Thank you for bringing them to me. What can I do to help you?

I recently found an injured traveler who was struck by a poisoned arrow and abandoned in the desert. His condition was so critical he needed immediate treatment. Understand? Well, then give me a hand. The pharmacist said the poison of the arrow is so rare we can only save his life by applying Hawk's Beak.

Go to the west gate and tell Security Chief Koop about it.	Honestly, I don't expect that he will do his job, but he has his own role. So go and tell Koop in front of the west gate of the village.

The Travelers' Champions, a group Kellog leads, is said to have even accepted the Redflag Combatants of Bandits' Village. They shared the Traveler's Luggage. How about asking them to retrieve the luggage first? Well, let's start there. I heard the traveler had three pieces of Luggage. When you get them, bring them to Safe Keeper Kellog east of the village, to keep him quiet.	Retrieve three pieces of Traveler's Luggage from the Redflag Combatants in the Village of the Shadows and take them to Safe Keeper Kellog east of the village.	Why did you come back? Ha!

From now on, I'll act according to my own plans. Do you want to hear my idea? It's so ingenious I believe we can deal a blow to the Champions. First, we'll get some monsters and leave evidence to make others believe the Champions killed them. This will bring up all kinds of conflict with each other. Sounds like an excellent idea to me! But there is one thing to be careful of; the monsters won't be easy to get. We have to hunt them so masterfully we don't leave our own evidence. You're the only person capable of doing such a masterful job around here. So, I want you to kill thirty Duriven Slugs. Then, I'll set a trap with the corpses. Do you understand?

We succeeded in getting the Duriven Slugs to fight with the pioneers. But we didn't expect the Duriven Slugs to ask for help from the Ghoul King Harn after they were overpowered. There's probably some sort of connection between the groups of monsters. Have you heard about Harn? Him entering the fight makes the situation significantly worse. Harn's attacks on travelers will be devistating. Yes, yes, I know. You don't have to tell me about it. I didn't think things would develop like this. Anyway, we have to get everything back to normal, don't we? Defeat Harn on the Wanderers' Plains. I won't ask anything more of you after that.	You seem to be scared. Sure, Harn in the Wanderer Plain is very strong, but from what I know of you, you're strong enough to beat him. You have a good chance of winning. Don't worry anymore. Just go and fight him!	I saw your amazing victory! What a great traveler you are! Thanks to you, the champions who had taken advantage of the traveler have fallen into disarray and the monsters are also severely weakened.

Redflags want to take the village back but they're not strong enough, so they asked us to help them. Although the Redflags live there,we won't be at risk because Zylok is so far from where the Redflags are. In addition, the Redflags promised us to give fair payment if we help them. I'll have the village prepare for the fight. Please deliver this news to Mercenary Scar in front of the North gate of the village.	Don't be late. Deliver the news to Mercenary Scar in front of the north gate of the village.	You intend to revive Bandit Village, right? Um... Bandit Village is very far from our village. I don't think there will be any problems for us, but some opposition is expected because some of the mercenaries have grudges against the Redflag Bandits.

Of course, their fellow mercenaries were brave too, but just like them, most of the mercenaries scattered and settled here and there. If they are reunited, they will have immense power. I suspect that Skita has already talked to Peabay so everything will be easier than we thought now. Find two Moon Elves' Studded Leather Cuirasses and give them to the Warrior Armor Merchant Peabay, just north of the village. He will like them because he has lots of interest in other tribe's armor.	I will say it again, please listen carefully. The two Studded Leather Cuirasses are Moon Elves'. Don't forget that.

Although she didn't belong to the mercenaries, she supported us from the shadows when Skita and Peabay were fighting as a pair. If she joins us, we'll definitely be an elite fighting force. The problem is that she won't easily accept our offer. As I told you, since she wasn't a mercenary, she won't listen to me, but that doesn't mean she's impossible to reason with... A few days ago, a Moon Elf named Grahams died in the Lufut Land, but her crossbow hasn't been retrieved yet. In reality,  I hid it amongst the rocks in the Lufut Land to prevent it being found. I knew I could use it later. Maybe the crossbow will be enough to motivate Shakran. Find Grahams' Crossbow and deliver it to the Archer Weapons Merchant Shakran north of the village.	Of course, Shakran is different from Skita and Peabay, so she may not accept our offer so readily. Find Grahams' Crossbow amongst the rocks in Lufut Land. Then go to the Archer Weapons Merchant Shakran, just north of the village and give the Crossbow to her.	Oh, I know why you're here. I've already heard from Peabay. You brought that Crossbow to win me over, right? Hmm. Moon Elves' bows make nice ornaments, but there's one thing Scar doesn't realize about me. No one can make a bow better than myself. I'll accept the Crossbow, but...																				159055957	3482	Grahams's Crossbow	1																	1. Find Grahams' Crossbow among the rocks in Lufut Land.	6	2.

Don't treat me like Peabay or Skita. I'm much more clever than they are. What made them think I would help thieves? As you can see, my answer is no. But don't worry too much. The men I sent while you were on your way here have probably made it to Skita and Koop. Peabay and I have not only opposed the battle but also pledged to defeat Redflag. I'm sure Skita and Koop are deeply offended right now. Ha! Ha! You may still get involved in this, but you need to face up to reality. I'll help you realize it for yourself. I heard that the Redflag Bandits got some neighboring monsters to help fight as soon as Skita raids. If the bandits and monsters attack from behind, Skita's troops will run into trouble. Go east of the Wanderer Plains and destroy thirty Trancorpse Sins, rendering their strategy useless.	You have to hurry. Save Skita and Peabay from a crisis by destroying thirty Trancorpse Sins east of the Wanderer Plains.	What a relief! The Redflags will be running scared.

Alchemists back in the Age of Chaos created a monster named Mastook to guard against anyone becoming Archlord. Mastook was very violent and was drawn to anyone who possessed an Archon. Finally the monster was destroyed, but his eye survived. It has amazing powers of clairvoyance. I've heard the eye is somewhere in Syllancium, but Mormorine is refusing to lend me the book that might explain where it is exactly. So what I'd like you to do is steal the book. I've heard Mormorine is so worried about me taking the book he's hidden it in a jar in front of his house. He'd never suspect you. Bring me the Fables of Chaos, a book hidden in a jar in front of Mormorine's house north of Trilgard.	I'm asking for a favor. Steal the Fables of Chaos from a jar in front of Mormorine's house north of Trilgard.	Thank you. I hope I can find what I'm looking for inside the book.

But Mastook's Eye is not in the building ruins the Metal Golems protect, but rather, the Metal Golems themselves carry the Eye. However, Mastook's Eye can't be retrieved simply by killing the Metal Golems anytime. It can only be retrieved while the spell written in this book is active. Could you destroy Metal Golems for me? But first, let me cast a spell... Okay, it's done. I hope it works. Destroy the Metal Golems in the Wanderer Plain and find  Mastook's Eye.	Move before the power of the spell dissipates. Destroy the Metal Golems in the Wanderer Plains and retrieve Mastook's Eye.	Hey! This is Mastook's Eye. Um... I think we can find Lawrence with it... Yes. I need Mastook's Eye to find my lover, Lawrence, who disappeared. There's no other reason, but it'll take some time to figure out how to handle the eye.

If you take too much time, he'll probably come looking for it. So, return the Fables to Sorcerer Mormorine north of Trilgard, promptly.	Ah, I thought so...  I was just going to go to Juwan. Aren't you ashamed of helping her steal things? Anyway, I felt something ominous because I had already heard why she wanted this book. But you brought it back.

If you're right, Juwan probably doesn't know how to use the Eye yet. She may be keeping it in storage. What you need to do is to steal the Eye. Why? Well, you don't know how to use it either. Besides clairvoyance, Mastook's Eye has enormous powers of destruction. There's a story saying as many as ten thousand sorcerers were killed by the power of the Eye while they tried to catch Mastook in the Age of Chaos. The Eye is very dangerous. It can wipe out Zylok in a fraction of a second, but she was so fascinated she wouldn't listen to me. There's not much time. The eye has probably been absorbing the power of souls ever since it came out of the heart of the Metal Golem. Steal the Mastook's Eye from Juwan's storage chest, just west of Zylok.	You reap what you sow. In other words, you started this so you have to help finish it. Steal Mastook's Eye from Juwan's storage stand, just west of Zylok.	You brought it. I'm relieved.

I spoke with them about the box, and I promised to put it where they want it to be, in the plain south of Beacon Village. I need your help because the plain is a dangerous place, as it's frequented by Silver Moths. Please guard me by defeating fifteen Giant Silver Moths south of Shump Village. Then go to the Villager Roten of Beacon village and explain to him.	Please. After defeating thirty Sword Turkavens in the Fallen Hills Area, take the whole story to Magic Weapons Merchant Juwan north of Zylok.	Ah... That's what happened. I was very perplexed, indeed.

Since then, a number of strange things have started happening. I seem to be losing items all the time and I feel all these eyes watching me day and night. I told this to Deathnote as he was passing by. He said if I needed help, just give the ring to him. So far I've just kept the ring with me because I was asked to, but something strange happened to me yesterday. I heard a crying sound coming from the ring. I can't stand it any more. I'd like to ask you something. Deliver this Ring to the Alchemist Deathnote in the center of the village.	Please deliver the Ring to Alchemist Deathnote in the center of the village.

With it, anybody can make a Golem his slave, but because it was made with Dark Sentio's power, it also brings a strong curse to the person who keeps it for too long. Another danger is that power coming from of the ring attracts Golems. Unless we do something, Golems in Silancium will eventually flock here. I'll risk my life for a just cause but I don't want to waste my life in vain. The ring must be destroyed. Alchemically, it will be possible but I need to do more experimenting. To do so, I need thirty Troll's Eyes. Destroy Rodam Breakers in the Vampire Village and use your Ransacking skill to get thirty Troll's Eyes. Take heart! It's all for the village.

As Security Chief, it's my job to handle this kind of thing, but I've got so much going on these days I can't give it the kind of attention it needs. I'm going to appoint you my deputy.

Well, it was near the western mouth of Windrill where I saw Falcon stabbing the traveler in the back. I was sleeping behind a rock. First, I thought it was a Redflag warrior I saw, but through a break in the sandstorm, I saw it was Falcon. He hid the knife in the crack of a rock. Hmm... Find the knife and confront Blacksmith Falcon with it. He's at the center of the village. There will be no way out for him. Could you do me that favor?	Was I mumbling? Find the knife in the cracked rock at the western entrance of Windrill, then confront Blacksmith Falcon with the knife. Stop bothering me.	That's the knife I lost.

My enemies are always looking for a chance to drive me out. I'm afraid this incident could work against me. Hmm, I just thought of something I could have you do. Telecaster said the monsters have a wand which will  react with the monster's evil spirits and make the Ghost appear. If the wand is destroyed, the Ghost won't come back. However, Telecaster will be ridiculed if there's no such thing. According to him, you can get the Wand from Duriven Fallens. Go ahead and get it if there is such a thing. Hahaha!	I have no expectations, but come back after you retrieve the Wand from the Duriven Fallens.	Ugh! This Wand... This is the Wand of Tarukra, who was one of my men a long time ago.

While going to Syllancium with her friends, two of them were swallowed by Uru. Do you know who Uru is? It is a Wyvern, notorious throughout Syllancium. I'm worried about Zuwan. She's so upset she wants to kill Uru without any preparation. She thinks she can lure Uru into a Magic Square and trap him there. Please protect her when she goes out to catch Uru. What you have to do is to kill any of the other monsters that might be around while she is making a Magic Square. You'll probably end up destroying sixty Black Hawkarrows at the eastern mouth of Windrill.	Please make sure she doesn't notice what you're doing. I don't want her to be suspicious.

That's just how vivid her personality is. We can't discourage her from doing it, so there's no other choice but to help her.

1444	Underground Tribe's Castle	Secrete of Dungeon	Delfaras; Iva	1		15				1			<Adventurer> Iva	<Adventurer> Iva				Have you ever heard about the dark, cold Underground World? They say there is a battlefield there, where all tribes can come together as one. The field is generally called the Battle Square. The record of the Elementals says that the Battle Square was the castle of an underground tribe who lived there in ancient times, but now it's known as a dungeon. A relevant record left by Sorcerer Michek is in the body of one of the Flame Bats guarding the dungeon. I have been there several times but the Bat is so strong I was unable to defeat it. Still, I think you can handle it. Go to the Battle Square, kill the Flame Bat and get Michek's Document from its body. You can get there using the Portal next to the east gate of the village. The place is very narrow so it will be hard for you to escape. You'd better go with a party and make sure you're well prepared.	Sorcerer Michek is nothing but a legend from an underground tribe. He once tried to get chaos under control but he was driven to another world during the battle. Anyway, go to Battle Square, kill the Flame Bat and retrieve Michek's Document. You can get there through the Portal next to the east gate.	You did a great job. This is Michek's Document, but I can't open the seal. On the surface... These are really sophisticated Elemental characters. I can barely read them... when the time comes... this will open. I don't get it. I'll have to give it some thought.

Take this Document to Pharmacist Joaquin southwest of the city and ask him.	Pharmacist Joaquin is a fairly mysterious character. He knows so much, but there's not much known about him. Take Michek's Document to Pharmacist Joaquin southwest of the city, and ask him.	You say you brought the Document? Let me see it. This is Sorcerer Michek's Document. Of course I can read it, but I can't explain it all right now because I am very busy. Wait for a moment.			767	Mikey's Document	1																																			1.

Perhaps you can do the hard work for me. I'll translate the document while you're at it. Oh, no. I'm not saying you should actually bring back the heart. An Earth Golem's Heart would turn to dust and blow away if you tried to remove it without the proper skills. What I need you to do is kill ten Earth Golems in Battle Square. Get there through the Portal next to the east gate. It's difficult to escape down the narrow passage, so I suggest you take the proper equipment and take a few friends to help you out.	This is urgent for both of us. I need Earth Golem's Heart and you need the Document. So go to Battle Square through the Portal next to the eastern gate and catch ten Earth Golems.	Thanks to you I got the Earth Golem Hearts I needed. Yes, I promised to tell you about the contents of the Document. Here's what I've learned so far.... Back when Battle Square was the castle of an underground tribe, the Square was under the control of Michek. However, he got into a disagreement with his colleague Rome, who ended up putting him in prison. Then Rome made the mistake of taking in Sorcerer Basarah to help him. Basarah quickly took over the castle and killed Rome. Michek escaped from prison somehow and fought Basarah, who eventually left the castle and it became Battle Square. That's all for today. I have to take care of other things. Just wait.						758	Earth Golem	10																																1. Destroy ten Earth Golems in Battlesquare.	4	2.

He was there to the guard five heroes who followed Mikey. They were detained deep in the dungeon. The five heroes probably have something to do with the Archlord. The rumor that there are people detained in the dungeon has been around for a long time. Maybe the rumor is true. I want to see this in person. Move to the Battle Square by using the Portal next to the east gate. And then, defeat Magmaron in the middle of Battle Square. I'll find out the whereabouts of the heroes. The place is so dangerous. So I suggest you take the proper equipment and go with a few others to help you out.	As he was chosen by Basarah to take care of the dungeon, Magmaron will have strong evil powers. Fortunately however, as he also has a weakness, so we can beat him. After moving to Battle Square through the Portal next to the east gate, defeat Magmaron in the middle of Battle Square. I will find out where the heroes are. The place is so dangerous. You'd better go only after putting together a party with others and making careful preparations.	You took down invincible Magmaron, but I can't find the five heroes. I've only found shackles as evidence they were there. I wonder where they've gone. Of course, as long as Basarah is alive, they probably won't show up. Only when Basarah has fallen will they see a peace. Anyhow, thank you for letting sunshine light the Battle Square.						760	Magmaron	1																																1. Defeat a Magmaron in Battlesquare.	4	2.

Records of the Battle Square left by Sorcerer Michek are said to be in the body of one of the Flame Bats guarding the dungeon. I've been there several times but the Bats are too strong for me. I think you'll be able to take them on though. Go to the Battle Square, destroy the Flame Bats and get the Michek's Document from them. You can get there through the Portal next to the east gate of the village. Once you enter, it won't be easy for you to escape, so I suggest you take the proper equipment and go with a few others to help you out.	Sorcerer Michek is nothing but a legendary sorcerer from the underground tribe. He once had control over the castle, but was driven out. Go to Battle Square, destroy the Flame Bat and retrieve Michek's Document. You can get there through the Portal next to the east gate.	So the legend must be true. This is Mikey's Document, but I can't open the seal. On the surface... My, these are really sophisticated characters of the Elementals. I can barely read them except when the time comes, ... it shall open. Do you know anyone who can read this?

Take the Document to Pharmacist Joaquin southwest of the city and ask for his help.	Frankly, he doesn't offer much. He's very knowledgeable, but always seems to say things I don't understand. Bring Michek's Document to Painter Syrien west of the city, and ask him about it.	Oh, it's good to see you. I was just wondering what I should paint. The Battle Square? Come to think of it, I've never painted that. Hey, what that document? Let me see it. Oh, my goodness. It is Sorcerer Michek's Document. Wait a minute while I wash out my brushes.

I can get pigment of a particular shade by boiling ground Earth Golem's Heart in a magic furnace. It's the perfect thing for an exciting Battle Square. So use the Portal northeast of the city square to get to Battle Square and destroy ten Earth Golems. Meanwhile, I'll do my job.	Thanks to you, I found good quality Earth Golem's Hearts. I promised to show you the contents of the Document, so I will.  First, let me tell you what I know based on my observations. Back when the Battle Square was the castle of the underground tribe, the Square was under the control of Michek. However, he got into a disagreement with his colleague Rome, who ended up putting him in prison. Then Rome made the mistake of taking in Sorcerer Basarah to help him. Basarah quickly took over the castle and killed Rome. Michek petitioned Basarah for his freedom and eventually he was allowed to leave. Since then, the castle turned into the Battle Square. I'm sure you want to know more, but I have other things to take care of.  Be patient.						758	Earth Golem	10																																1. Destroy ten Earth Golems in Battlesquare.	4	2.

Basarah left the land that was sought after by all tribes.  But Magmaron, his right-hand man, still remained.  It was his job to protect the five heroes, who followed Mikey, and who were imprisoned in the dungeon. The five heroes probably have something to do with the Archlord.  Rumors that there are people detained in the dungeon have been around a long time.  Maybe the rumor happens to be true. I'd like to see for myself.

So I suggest you take the proper equipment and go with a few others to help you out.	Your fight with Magmaron would be a great painting theme, but I think heroes are more suitable for me. I will paint you in the corner if you come to mind. After moving to Battle Square by using the Portal northeast of the city square, defeat Magmaron in the middle of Battle Square.	Well, you took down invincible Magmaron, but I failed to find the five heroes. I only found shackles as evidence that they were there. Those aren't exciting to paint. I'm very disappointed. I wonder where they've gone. As long as Basarah is alive, they probably won't turn up. If the heroes do show up, I'll paint them something wonderful. Anyhow, you did a great job.

Usually, however, the answer to these kinds of problems is pretty simple. Drive the monsters out of there and bad things won't happen. Don't you think? So I need you to defeat twelve Young Direwolves at Ariel. I haven't felt this bad in a while. I don't know where these omens came from, but if you succeed in defeating the Direwolves, these bad omens won't harm anyone. May the protection of the Elementals be with you.	Please defeat twelve Young Direwolves at Ariel. May the protection of the Elementals always be with you.	Well done. Fortunately, none of my customers have had an accident so far.

So I did a little research about the monsters in the neighborhood and got some information. Bandillions north of Laflesia started moving in gradually. I'm trying to get more detailed information about the Bandillions, but it's not easy to go undercover whilst among them. So, I need you to distract them a little. Please defeat seven Bandillion Soldiers on the Path of Glory. While you distract them, I'll continue to gather information about them. They may seem to be just soldiers, but that doesn't mean you can take them lightly. Be careful.	Defeat seven Bandillion Soldiers on the Path of Glory.	Well done.

It's such a shame I lost it. Fortunately, they don't seem to know where the plans are yet. They think I have them. However, I think they are bold enough to go ahead with their original plans even without the written plans in hand. They wouldn't care about such small things. So, we need to find the plan and get the information. Fortunately, I know where I lost it. Find the Bandillion's Plan at Ariel and give it to Kariel who lives east of Laflesia. There might be some Bandillion soldiers still there. Just watch yourself. May the blessings of the Elementals shine on your path.	Find the Bandillion's Plan and deliver it to Kariel.

A large amount of horse feed would mean they have many horses for their cavalry. It's simply too dangerous to let them build an army of any size. We're supposed to ask Kiprosos for his opinion first, but we can't afford to wait. They get the feed today. I need you to first defeat Veteran Jung of Bandillion south of Rualala and bring me the Horsefeed. You can just bring it to me even if there isn't much. With the feed, I can determine the size of their existing cavalry and its type. So, get going.	If we have the knowledge of what type of cavalry they are building and how large it is, it will be much easier to fight back. So, I need something to estimate the figures.

The best quarry is west of Norine. So I traveled out there with my pick and out of nowhere, a group of Lamias attacked me. It wasn't that difficult to run them off, but my pick was broken in the process. That really makes me angry whenever I think about it. Seriously. So, I need you to meet with Sorcerer Neural at the center of Laflesia and ask him how to defeat all those Lamias.  May the hammer of the Elementals pave the way for you.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, Lamias have a very strict hierarchy. They distinguish their classes with smell. They may not really look distinctive, but Lamias are very sensitive to the scent of their own kind. Accordingly, we have an easier answer than we expected. Just make yourself smell like a strong Lamia. The problem is, I don't really know which one is strongest. For this, we need some tricks. I actually left a monster mark at a bridge near Rualala. The mark records information about monsters passing by. I need to look at the record and see which one was the strongest. I need you to bring me the Lamia's Mark from Rualala. May the knowledge of the Elementals bless your path.	Why are you hesistating? Bring me Lamia's Mark from Rualala, quickly. There's simply no other option if you linger around here.

You met Cariten before coming here, right? What do you think of him? You think he pretends to be active but is actually indecisive? Well, in a sense, you're right. He and I had the ceremony of Para Siempre. But that was just the ceremony. Other than that, nothing changed from before to after the ceremony. Pardon? Is Cariten's Para Siempre me? Why, you haven't heard of it? Well, that's just how he does everything. You want to know why he behaves like that? It's because of our families. Family unity is generally weak in the Moon Elf community, except for his and mine. Our families are still growling at each other over which one has the oldest history in Laflesia. Isn't it just stupid? I just don't understand why this is important. By the way, I guess I have to do this. Well, before telling you that, can you bring me some Red Divination Grass from Lunaway Swamp? I need the grass to accomplish what I'm trying to do, and I can disclose it to others only when it's completed. Please. May the protection of the kind Elementals always be with you.

It might be easier for you to go alone than to take a total novice like me with you. Ok. I'll just leave everything to you. Rodellite has many different meanings since it's so beautiful. For example, giving six Rodellites means I dedicate my passion and love to only you forever. And I'd like to say that to Cariten with this flower. It may give him a chance to break free from the family. To be honest with you, I wish he would give me Rodellites. But if I wait for that to happen, I won't receive the flowers until I return to the Elemental world.

She will make much better  judgments, and give orders which will help you more. So, please give Siaforce's Report to Dalicent in Laflesia.	What's up? Siaforce sent it to me?

One of my customers just encountered some Young Torges on the way to my store. That customer swore he wouldn't come back here until they were under control. He used to travel a fair distance to get here. If I keep losing my customers like this, there will be serious damage to my reputation as well as my business. I won't be able to get fine things, and customers only come to me if my stock is good. So I need to continue to please my customers and get better merchandise. I can't afford to lose any more customers. So, I want you to defeat ten Young Torges East of Laflesia. I know it's just a temporary solution, but that would please my customers to a certain extent.

You go right ahead and defeat fifteen Marylith Liquids. Blessings to you in the name of the Elementals and me.	What's taking you so long? Go and do the work. I didn't hire you so I could just watch you idling around. Defeat those fifteen Marylith Liquids and then you can see me. Blessings to you in the name of the Elementals.	Why are you so slow!?

It's a great opportunity to strengthen my position in Laflesia, so you need to do this right. Once it's finished, you can go on your own. It means you don't have to show your ugly face to me anymore. What's the job? Since when did you become someone who dares ask me questions? You just stay still until I tell you what to do. Now, there's a unique Marylith near Laflesia, called Arniel. It is strong and smart, so it's a headache to Laflesia. I know Kiprosos is also working hard to kill that wretched thing, but his efforts are in vain. If you can defeat Arniel west of the Karebun Road and take the Proof of Hunting to City Representative Kiprosos in the center of Laflesia under my name, he will finally realize his limits. Do you understand? If you do, then go. You'd better succeed in this. I will not forget your name if you make it. Otherwise, I'll make sure no one remembers your name ever.

I was attacked by Death Eyeballs on my way back from a neighboring town after shopping. I would've driven them away, but I was ambushed. Anyway, half of what I bought was broken. It wasn't like this before, but these days the monsters make it really difficult to get supplies. Can you go north of the Karebun Road and defeat twelve of those darn Death Eyeballs? I'd come up with a reward for that. May the Elementals watch over you.	Those things are really hurting my business. Please defeat twelve Death Eyeballs north of the Karebun Road.

There are several family clans with lots of history in Laflesia. The oldest of all is my Glory of the West. We have always been in Laflesia and always will be. But these days there's trouble in our glorious family. I'm talking about my son, the black sheep. This rascal dares to date a daughter of the Radiance of the East clan. They're frivolous and lowly. They even shamelessly insist that their clan has the oldest history. I just can't let him go on like this. Please go and talk to my son Safe Keeper Cariten in the middle of the northern part  of Laflesia and tell him to wake up. If an outsider like you says this to him, he might come to his senses. May the Elementals watch over you.	Please go and talk to the Safe Keeper Cariten and tell him to wake up. He won't listen to me any longer. May the Elementals watch over you.	Father sent you here. Then you heard the story. Yes, it's true. Lincent and I had the Ceremony of Para Siempre. But my Glory of the West clan and her Radiance of the East have had a long and bitter feud. In fact, they have been together since the very early stages of Laflesia. But nowadays they fight over who has the longer history. But I don't care. I just want to be with her.

But using a rather shocking method might be effective in this case. In fact, Lincent and I both abandoned our clans' crests. We thought we would be able to at least partially make ourselves understood to the elders of the two clans and avoid interference but it turned out to be useless. Now all I can do is give back my crest. It means I choose to leave the clan and live on my own. If I do that, I can be independent from any type of clan influence. That's not the way Moon Elves usually live. I do want to be recognized by everyone. If not everyone, at least I want my family to recognize me but if that doesn't work...can you help me?

Great, I would really appreciate it if you could! But I don't even know their names. Oh, you can go to Alchemist Robello just north of Laflesia. He should know what those monsters are.

These can terrify Ronendl better than any other creatures around here. Some may say they're cute, though, and I tend to agree. They're called Broken Avengers. These poor things came into the world because of insane alchemists. As an alchemist myself, I just can't forgive those who would make such a thing. Apart from disregarding the dignity of life, they created things they can't even be responsible for and now they frighten people. What a shame. I'll need to find out who made these.

And the taste of the special Boar dish served at the height of the festival is most exquisite! If I dare to compare the taste, Hasesana alone is that delicious.

First of all, the monsters are united enough to attack Deribelle right now, but they're not. There must be a reason. Without knowing it, we shouldn't draw any conclusions. Your mission is to find out the current status of the monsters. That sounds like an enormous job, but all you have to do is destroy monsters as usual. Kill ten Rock Torges and ten Vampire Bats in Lands End. Given the recent relations of monsters, such an attack will force them to do something. We will closely watch their reactions and find out what secrets they're hiding. I know they're not easy to deal with but I think we can trust you, the one Great Elder Aratama introduced to us. May the ancient wisdom and soul of the Elementals be with you!	Destroy ten Rock Torges and ten Vampire Bats at Lands End. May the ancient wisdom and soul of the Elementals be with you.	Welcome.

One of the scouts returned with a very interesting message. While you were destroying monsters, Hukarung, Chief of the Trolls, went berserk. He's more intelligent than other monsters, so it's possible he reacted in a stronger way. That seems to indicate a grand master is behind all this and I want to know who it is. We'll be able to find out more if we investigate the Proof of the Covenant the scouts had said Hukarung possesses. Destroy the Troll Chief Hukarung in the Hunter's Forest and bring back the Proof of the Covenant. Maybe the truth is even scarier than we think. Maybe all this is related to the darkness in Northern Land. I hope I'm all worked up about nothing but the truth will reveal itself soon.

This is not written in any book. This is folklore so you may not have heard it before. Long ago, the Moon Elf ancestors who founded Deribelle were expanding their territory northward, and they came across a powerful monster. This monster was beyond description. She had many monsters doing her bidding and she harassed and tormented the Moon Elves. Our ancestors gathered people with special powers to fight her. Their combat skills were minimal but they had this special power to permanently seal the target they wanted. In the end, with great sacrifice, she, the queen of monsters, the Queen of the Dead, was sealed away for eternity! That is where the Queen of the Dead is now located.  And now... she is trying to resurrect herself. This is very dangerous. Her power has escaped the seal and is manipulating other monsters! Please report this to the Great Elder Aratama southeast of Deribelle. I have to do more research. May the ancient wisdom and soul of the spirits be with you!	It's now clear she's trying to break the seal! But surely, there's a way to stop her. I have to find out how. Go to the Great Elder Aratama southeast of Deribelle and report this. May the ancient wisdom and soul of the Elementals be with you.	Welcome, young traveler. You don't look good today. What is the matter? Kiriscent?

Argh, this is my worst nightmare! By now I might be the only one who can remember her. People who rose up against her died in vain before their time. Only a few, including myself, survived till now and If she is let loose again, we have no way to stop her. All we can do is buy more time while Kiriscent finds out ways to reinforce the seal. We should do what we have to do. First of all, fight off one hundred Canedog Combatants and two Wild Liches near the Blood Altar. If my memory serves me right, their job is to provide nutrition the Queen needs. May the guidance of the Elementals show you the light!	I don't know how much time is left for us, but we have to do our best! Fight off one hundred Canedog Combatants and two Wild Liches near the Blood Altar.

I think I should tell you about that devil.  I'm sure you've already heard parts of this since you've been here a while. A long time ago, I lost my entire family to one monster. His name was Logos. He's also known as the King of the Moon. His strength is believed to go beyond anybody's imagination. When I confronted him, he just seemed like a huge wall to me. None of my skills made any harm him. He eventually wiped out my whole family and disappeared, leaving me with a serious wound and a permanently broken heart. I'll never forget that day. Oh, look at me rambling on and on. Anyway, the dung you brought isn't Logos'. Looks to me like it's not a singel monsterl, but a group of them, and there are at least two types of monsters mingling together.  I'm sorry, but would you inform Commander Berceluna of this fact? She's on the south side of Deribel. I'm sure she'll take appropriate meausures. Thanks.	I'm sorry, but just leave me alone. I have something to think about.

You just thought you'd drop by and see how I am? Well, unfortunately I can't answer 'I'm good.' In fact, I'm having some problems with the Canedog Combatants. Even the Karebun Road connecting Laflresia and Deribelle was once blocked, the road used to deliver Hasesana. Fortunately, the road is open again thanks to Bercelluna and the guards, but the Hasesana shipments have dropped by nearly half and some of my customers were hurt. Oh, it's just a huge mess. We Moon Elves love Hasesana. What's the use of living if we can't even taste and smell the sweet, sweet Hasesana juice? It's just terrible. Maybe that's why I'm so weary these days. If I could, I'd take revenge on the Canedog Combatants, but I can't because I'm so weak. Oh, it's so stressful. What? You'd like to help? Oh... Thank you so much.

More than five hundred years ago, Deribelle was founded. Elder Aratama is the only person who has lived here all that time. Moon Elves live so long we rarely make history books, and that habit often gets us into trouble. In order to prevent such problems in the future, I'm writing various history books as an archeologist. Currently I'm working on the history of Deribelle. Of course, I'm also doing research on other important matters at the same time. One of them is the Queen of the Dead. Her legend and the creation of Deribelle date back to almost the same period.  Aratama said that too, but unfortunately, Aratama's memory isn't as good as it used to be. So I usually collect several items and do comparitive research like this. Oh, I'm sorry for rambling. Could you get me two Antidote Potions from Merchant Velven, just south of Deribelle?

Oh, I guess I haven't told you the reason, yet. Well, I think that Canedogs are simply followers of Gnolls. The reason can be found in the period when Canedogs first started to make their presence known around Deribelle.  Before the birth of Deribelle and Canedogs, only Gnolls used to live around here. So I figured out that finding the origin of Canedogs would help me interpret the history of Deribelle from a new perspective. That's why I am asking for your help. You think you sort of understand? Hahaha! Archeology is, by its nature, somewhat confusing and vague.  At one moment, you think you know something, but the next moment, you don't know anything at all. And when you gradually start unravelling each problem, you discover new answers and new problems. That's why archaeology is so attractive.

2274	Houdian's Arrow	Broken Bow	Deribelle; Hudian	1		31				3			<Hunter> Hudian	<Hunter> Hudian				Welcome, traveler. I was looking for you. Recently, I was hunting near the region of the Queen of the Dead with some other hunters from the city when we were attacked by monsters. We managed to escape without any major injuries because Kiriscent and Berceluna had warned us before we left and we prepared accordingly. Howver, during the fighting, I lost my bow. Without it, I can't hunt. I'm sorry, but could you go find the Broken Bow in the region of the Queen of the Dead, southwest of Deribel? May you be blessed with the wisdom of the Elementals.	I would like you to find the Broken Bow near the Queen of the Dead, southwest of Deribelle. May you be blessed with the wisdom of the Elementals!	Hmm... It's badly broken.

Whenever I go hunting, I keep an arrow at my side. Yes, it's quite uncomfortable, but there's a good reason for it. As you know, for a long time, we Moonelves used to have rituals before going hunting. Today, short, simple rituals have taken the place of the traditionally longer ones. Hunters also carry with them a special symbol of their own to prevent injuries and to pay honor to their game. My symbol is an arrow. I think hunting with an arrow by my side is a way of paying true respect to my sport. Well, that's the arrow I've lost. I can vaguely recall where I last had it, but as a hunter who has broken his bow and lost his symbol, I can't leave the city. My pride won't allow it. Can you look for the arrow for me? First, use this Houdian's Work Knife to search the rocks in the Spores of Joy, south of Deribelle. I'm sure my arrow will be stuck in one of the rocks.  Please.

Others may not be taking this seriously, but Berceluna is complaining already that it's hard to find good clothes these days. It's understandable, though since she frequently gets into fights with monsters and it's a nuisance to repair torn clothes every time.

There are ruins of an ancient people who lived there long before the Moon Elves. Of course, the place had a different name then, not a shocking one like Blood Altar. The original temple was built to praise the Elementals, but it was destroyed by the Queen of the Dead, along with all the ancient inhabitants. When Moon Elves began to live in Deribelle, the place changed. It was no longer a place to praise the Elementals but a fierce battleground where the Queen of the Dead and Moon Elves fought fiercely. The Queen slew so many elves their blood covered the altar. Since then the place has been called the Blood Altar and become a place of fear to Moon Elves. Even after the Queen was sealed away, elves still avoided that place. But not everybody is afraid. For a Halfling Sorcerer like me, it's a place for new knowledge rather than fear. Anyway, I talk too much. What I ask is not difficult. All you have to do is take this Amber Stone to Observer Elkain. He's protecting the Altar of Blood... What? Who is this Elkain?

The one who successfully completes the quest by bringing the stone is worthy of witnessing the end of Lairien. Yes, you're right. It was Lairien who pointed you out and who needed Amber Stone. Now, move closer to Lairien. Give the Amber Stone to Lairien, protector of the Blood Altar. May the guidance of the Elementals light the hero's path!	Give the Amber Stone to Lairien, who protects the Blood Alter. May the guidance of the Elementals light the hero's path!	Welcome, young hero. I praise the Elementals for sending a hero like you to help me in my last moment. Looking at you, I see youth, pure passion and fair mind. I'm lucky to have someone like you with me as I face my last moment. Thank you for coming, young hero, I really appreciate it. I pray to the Elementals that youth, innocence and justice will always be with you.			2818	Amber Stone	1																																			1.

Ah, you're modest enough to decline that title. Good. Then I'll call you brave warrior and there is an incident for a warrior like you to deal with. As a matter of fact, the incident itself is not that big a problem, but with most of Deribelle's defense forces already exhausted from carrying out an operation to eliminate monsters outside Deribelle, we need help. Your mission is to destroy ten Giant Silver Moths in the border area between Lucrea Ame and the Spores of Joy. It shouldn't be too difficult for you but given the increasing monster activities, the situation isn't too easy either. Don't let your guard down when you get there. I wish you luck.

As it is now, Deribelle is in grave danger. But sitting on our hands and worrying will do nothing. We need help from warriors like you. Your job is to destroy Wilnar at the Blood Altar and take Wilnar's Heart to Elder Aratama southeast of Deribelle.

Will you lend a helping hand to this place which has lost the power of the Elementals? You see long before the Moon Elves arrived in Chantra, people lived here who filled this place with the pure power of the Elementals. They would be shocked to see how monsters are now defiling their cherished ground but I think something even more sinister is at work now. The energy of young the Moon Elf warriors who sacrificed themselves to seal the Queen of the Dead remains here as well, and I think these monsters were sent here by more powerful monsters, to prevent the Elementals from purifying this place once again. That would be a tragic loss. Without the energy of the Elementals and our Ancestors, this place is nothing but old ruins. So I want to ask a favor of you. Go to the Spores of Joy Zone and destroy twenty Windboar Imps, who are masterminding monsters. Please, young hero, I implore you. May the guidance of the Elementals light the hero's path!

Let's get back to the matter at hand. The number of shipments delivered from Laflesia has been dwindling due to all these new monster activities. Last time, most of the goods were broken in monster attacks. As things stand I'll run out of items to sell, let alone the trust my clients have in me. So I want you to fight off the monsters for me.

This is not much of a reward, but I want to tell you a story. You may have heard some of this before, but long ago this place was a fierce battleground between Moon Elves and the Queen of the Dead. Here, Moon Elves collected the energy of the Elementals to seal the Queen and this is where the Queen sent massive forces to prevent it. Blood flowed at this place for ten days and nights. The Queen's forces succeeded in destroying the Moon Elf Guards, but the Elves completed the seal at the last moment. So in the end, both sides were devastated. Unfortunately one warrior of the Queen's forces survived. Her name is Queen Firianes... She disappeared after the battle and nobody has seen her since. But recently I've had this ominous feeling. I think she has returned, though I don't know where she is. Aratama was the only Moon Elf to survive the battle with the Queen. He may have some insight on how to find her. So young hero, please hurry to Elder Aratama southeast of Deribelle, and convey my concerns. May the guidance of the Elementals light the hero's path!	Go immediately to Elder Aratama southeast of Deribelle, and tell him this story. Please, young hero, may the guidance of the Elementals light the hero's path!	Welcome, young traveler.

I never imagined the devil was still alive. In that case, I have to take back what I said earlier. Nothing is more important than this. If she's still alive, who knows what could happen? But we still don't know where she is, so we have to proceed carefully, one step at a time. Yes. Then first, young hero, bring me ten Wolves' Hides from the Young Dreadwolves in the Spores of Joy. They'll be used to make new armor for the Deribelle guards, so please hurry up. Meanwhile, I will try to find out the whereabouts of that devil Queen Firianes...

To us Moon Elves, she was better known as the Assassin of Despair... I found out where she is now. I think the devil is north of the region of the Queen of Lion. It seems she's being drawn to the increasing energy of the Queen. Don't underestimate Firianes' power... her cleverness.. During the battle at the Blood Altar between Moon Elves and monsters led by Firianes, we were slaughtered. Countless Elves died at her hand. It was a miracle from the Elementals that we completed the seal under those circumstances. Firianes' power... it's beyond words. And now the Assassin has reappeared. Still, we may be able to destroy her if we act quickly. The energy from the Queen of the Dead is still impaired for now. So I want to ask you. I know this is hard, but can you destroy Queen Firianes in the region of the Queen of Lion and take her Necklace to Elder Sharin Hyren at the center of Tor Fortress?

Now that Queen Firianes has been dealt with, we're waging a fierce battle with the thieves called Spriggans and we're in need of strong warriors. We just received a new message about it. According to our scouts, Spriggans seem to have hidden their tactical report in Stormroad. If we can acquire that report, we'll know exactly what they're up to. So I want you to go to Stormroad and find the Spriggans' Report. You're the only one we can trust to do this without failing. Please. May the guidance of the Elementals show you the light!

Storm Road? Well, a long time ago, thunder and lightning used to hit Storm Road almost constantly. It has abated somewhat nowadays, but instead the angry voices of monsters fill the place. So really, nothing much has really changed, heh. Of course, no one can deny Storm Road was a much more elegant place in the past. The ultimate purpose of the monsters swarming Storm Road nowadays is to get rid of us Moon Elves. It's because we sealed the Queen of the Dead. But their evil purpose doesn't mean we should lay down our lives without putting up a good fight. Still, we can't risk even a single life in vain. That's why we need more information. Of course, if we send out our scouts carelessly, they're sure to encounter Spriggans. What we need now is something to distract the Spriggans' attention. Yes? Are you suggesting you will be a decoy? ... It's a great idea but also very dangerous. What? You say we should trust the hero? Indeed, you are the hero of Deribelle. We will trust you.

The Spriggans' leader is Darkhan. Their strategy is to advance toward Stormroad and completely stop all transportation between Deribelle and Tor Fortress. This can be done by blocking Deadline and the Nightmare Valley. Does it sound impossible? Well, the Spriggans have never been so united, so it may happen. That means the only thing for us to do now is destroy their center. Yes. That's it. So I want to ask this of you. I understand you are still tired after your last battle but there is nobody else who can succeed in this dangerous mission. Dispose of Darkhan on the border area between Deadline and the Curse Valley and bring back Darkhan's Sword. Please. May the guidance of the Elementals show you the light!

I would go there myself... but... well, when it comes to Lardet... we don't seem to understand each other. How shall I put this... Elf arrogance?

He is not sure whether the tools belong to me but somebody told him that there are some stolen goods in a certain place. If they are mine, I'd really like to get them back. What kind of goods, you ask? They're not anything grand, they're just a tinderbox and an oil bottle, but they are not exactly ordinary. When I left the Elf village, an elder of the village gave them to me. So I really want them back. Fortunately Gustof seems to have some clues about where they are. So go find him and help him.

There must be a reason, but it is not important now. The priority here is finding Gylton's missing goods. I think you already know this but the tinderbox and oil bottle she lost are very valuable. Hmm? You wonder why the tinderbox and oil bottle are so important? Oh. you didn't hear the stories about them? The tinderbox is a wonderful object. It can light a fire even in water and the oil bottle is a magic bottle. I mean literally. It always keeps itself full no matter how much oil you use. If you sold them, the price would be unimaginably high. Ah.. Look at me. I'm bragging about something that isn't even mine. Anyway, let's find them.

This red line is the Spriggan's final defensive line which we secured after we repelled them the last time. As you can see, we forced them to retreat quite far from here thanks to you. The problem is this blue line. This is where Spriggan Chasers and Warriors are waging a fight. You see, the battle zone isn't fixed and spreads over a quite large area. In other words, they're not attacking us in groups but making small surprise attacks on strategic places, giving us a lot of trouble. Without disposing of them, we can't ensure peace in Tor Fortress. That's why I looked for you. It's very hard to find somebody who isn't widely known to Spriggans but has enough ability to fight them off.

As I look you, I can see you have some talent, and a person with raw talent needs some sound advice, right? Yes. There is a job just for you. Do you want it? Okay. If you do this and do it right, I'll give you some good advice. Yes. You might wonder what this job could be. It's not something grand. A while ago some Spriggan Ironclad Soldiers caused us trouble. Fortunately, they retreated when our guards arrived suddenly, but as it turns out, the guards couldn't figure out where they retreated to. Now it looks like they're regrouping and planning to come back again. We can't let that happen, can we? So what you have to do is destroy twelve Spriggan Combatants in the Valley of Curses. This is for the good of Tor Fortress. May the Elementals help you.	Destroy twelve Spriggan Combatants in Curse Valley. May the Elementals aid you.	Well done. You look like you've been through a lot.

It dates back to the last battle with the Queen of the Dead. You might have heard about it. Since the queen was sealed with the blood of Moonelves, the fortress didn't become a battleground, even though it was built for that purpose. Ironically, the fortress became very useful in another way. It served as the first barrier to ward off the attacks of Humans. Nowadays we're on good terms with them but in the past, their reckless expansion caused some clashes with us Moon Elves. Every time, this fortress acted as the first barrier to ward Humans off. Interesting, eh? So, have you met Bolanmar? If you're looking for work, pay him a visit. He's looking for somebody to help him. Go to Alchemist Bolanmar south of Tor Fortress.

Long ago, even before Great Elder Aratama was born, it's said all kinds of weapons were made from the ore. But now people doubt the ore even exists. However, one rumor says Spriggans have found an ore believed to be Moon Shadow. Barun said he saw Spriggan Chasers and Warriors moving some strange ore. They may have found what we're looking for. I want to go to confirm it, but these days it's so dangerous to go outside the fortress alone. Can you to help me?

Still, it came as a big surprise. I didn't think their armor manufacturing skill was that sophisticated. If it's possible, I'd like to inspect one of the armor pieces myself. Can you help me?

Don't look at me like that, the reason I was looking for you is not my personal grudge. I have to deliver a message to you from my sister Sharin Hyren, who is also the elder of Tor Fortress. She said the forces of Spriggan Ironclad Soldiers is growing. The defensive line we formed in our previous victory fell back again. She wants you to handle the guerilla fight to deal with them and has put you in charge of the operation. It doesn't matter what kind of methods you use. She only asked you to destroy ten Spriggan Ironclad Soldiers in Stormroad. I don't know why she speaks so highly of you, but don't let her down by doing something foolish. Good luck.

Unlike me, she is a respectable and generous enough person to forgive the sorry excuse of a father we have. But contrary to my sister, I cannot forgive that trash. Never. My sister is worried about me, and I hate to add to her worries. So when you meet her, don't talk about unnecessary things. I talked too long.

Is she still blaming our father? Yeah, you're speachless now. I know what she's like. I can guess what Sara told you. I see. I'll talk about this some more another time. There is a more urgent matter now. First of all, thanks to your guerilla operation, the strength of Spriggan Ironclad Soldiers has diminished considerably. This is very fortunate for us. But there are some remaining problems. The twin leaders of the Spriggan Ironclad Soldiers, Pamashura and Shamashura are urging their soldiers to penetrate our line of defenses. If it is possible, I'd like to end this battle with Ironclad Soldiers once and for all, but doing so would mean considerable damage to our side also. That is not what I want. So I looked for ways to minimize the damage to our side while defeating the Ironclad Soldiers.... It seems you're the only one who can pull this off. You should take down Pamashura and Shamashura.

The Spriggans seemed to be bringing in Vampires, thinking their forces alone wouldn't be enough. The price may be the blood of the people in this fortress. I will never let that happen. We have to separate the Spriggans from the Vampires. It is now or never. Their leader, the Queen of the Dead, has not yet awakened. First, you should go destroy ten Spriggan Guards and ten Vampires outside the north gate of Tor Fortress. Meanwhile, our scouts will spread misinformation among those two groups to make it seem like they're already fighting amongst themselves. Then we will wait and see how effective the result will be. Please hurry. May the fair judgment of the Elementals bring glory to your path.	First you should go destroy ten Spriggan Guards and ten Vampires outside the north gate of Tor Fortress. Will you hurry up? May the fair judgment of the Elementals bring glory to your path.	Good work. While you were away, our guards successfully spread rumors among the Spriggans and the Vampires. The only thing remaining is to drive the Spriggans out completely. Can you help us with this last mission?						733	Vampire	10					807	Spriggan Guard	10																									1.

What is left is the Spriggan Lord Charasuka and a few protecting him. Yes. What you have to do is destroy Charasuka in the region of the Floating Prison and bring back Charasuka's Sword. That alone won't put an end to it all. The Queen still remains, but at least that will bring an end to the long battle between the Spriggans and Tor Fortress.

May the fair judgment of the Elementals bring glory to your path.	Well done. You deserve to be called a hero. Elder Aratama sent a message just now.

I guess we're just kindred spirits as they say. So let me give you some advice. This lonely village is located in the middle of the desert and there's nothing surrounding it, so we're vulnerable from all directions. There are lots of thieves targeting merchants traveling here, so lone travelers like you tend to draw the wrong kind of attention. If you lose favor with the village chief, your life may suddenly become very difficult. This is a Letter of Introduction among us Kobolts. If you go North East of the Village and show it to Headman Yon, he'll trust you.	Don't think you can do everything for yourself. So show this Letter of Introduction to Headman Yon northeast of the village.	My, my. Is Toray playing a trick again? Ah, it may be an overstatement to call it a trick. When Toray meets adventurers he likes, he gives them his own letter of introduction. At least the letter shows he trusts you, but what he said is true. This village is so isolated we can't welcome just any traveler. We select them with a thorough procedure. You're no exception.			3500	Toray's Letter of Introduction	1																																			1.

You give me the impression you're not an ordinary person. Maybe he felt it too, but that's a personal opinion, and I need objective judgment on this. I'll give you a mission and judge you according to the results. If you go south outside the village, there are monsters called Gray Dingos. They harass travelers coming to this village. To teach them a lesson, destroy them and bring back thirty-five Dingo's Fangs. You won't need any collecting skills.	First, I'd like to see what you can do. If you go south outside the village, there are monsters called Gray Dingo's. Destroy them and bring back thirty-five Dingo's Fangs.	Hmm... You brought them without difficulty.

I know this can be annoying, but can you show me your abilities once more? We have to be able to trust you when we're in need. If you don't want to, you should leave this village at once. There's nothing but desert ahead and I don't think you want to stay where there's no village, right? So go to the Cave town Rock and bring back the Territorial Marks of Cavemen. That's your test.	Cavemen used to live in Cave Town but they're all gone now. Their cave houses and traces are still there, though. Anyway. Bring back the Territorial Marks of Cavemen from the Cave Town Rock.

It's not much. Eleven thousand Gold will be enough. You know, this is a hard place to live in, so we're forced to do something close to begging. I'm sorry.	You may not like the idea of paying eleven thousand Gold now, but when you leave this village, I'm sure you'll have objects a thousand times more precious. You can look forward to that.	Thank you. I have nothing to say other than that. Now I can say this. Welcome to Hideback Village!		11000																																						1. Aquire 11,000 Gold.	2	2.

I'm sorry to ask this of you since we've just met, but it's hard to find adventurers as talented as you are. It's my daughter who was kidnapped by Trancorpse Guilties. They demand I give them some objects in exchange for her. The thing is that the objects they want are not in my possession. They're hidden out in Windrill. The monsters know where the objects are... Please. Let's take this one step at a time. First, I need you to find the Scriptures of Mansur. It is said that they are hidden in the cracks of the rocks in the Boundary of life.	Don't forget my daughter's life depends on you. Find the Scriptures of Mansur hidden in the cracks of the rock in the Border of Life.	Thank you. This Mansur... He was an alchemist who lived before the Age of Chaos. I heard his research was mostly on Trancorpse Guilties. Well... That's not important now.

Anyway, bring it to me.	There is no time to waste. Find the Scriptures of Higgins hidden below the Cave Town Rock.	Now we have both of the objects they demanded.

She must be terrified. Yes, I'll grab my weapon. Will you help me? Destroy thirty-five Trancorpse Guilties in Cavetown. Meanwhile I'll rescue my daughter!	I can act only if you act first.

According to what he said, the potion the Trancorpse Guilties used is a kind of anesthetic which cavemen once used. If the potion taker doesn't use a certain stimulant, he'll fall asleep and starve to death. It's hard to find that kind of stimulant these days, but the sorcerer said we can get some from the Cave Wings in Cave Town. Since Cave Wings are so voracious, they will eat almost everything in the cave. We have no choice but to expect that the stimulant may remain in their stomach. Please, destroy the Cave Wings and find the Stimulant of the Cavemen!	There's a rumor that Cave Wings are bats domesticated by Cavemen. I don't know if that rumor is true but, please destroy the Cave Wings in Cave Town and bring back the Cavemen's Stimulant!	Good job! Give the Stimulant to me now!

If he thinks he has to take care of it himself, why did he come to me? Oh! Are you willing to help him? Well, that's up to you. What he asked for wasn't physical protection. It was thirty-five slabs of Venison, I think. He plans to distract the monsters into going another direction while he passes through. I think it's a stupid idea, but he said he would offer a handsome reward if he gets past the monsters safely. You can use your Meat Carving skill on the Night Bucks near the Blood Shelter in Silancium to get the Venison.	This is none of my business, but you said you'd help.

Many people wrote epics and songs about that battle. The most famous is the Gallitos Series. Have you ever heard about those books? It was written by a renowned sorcerer, Gallitos. The songs and images were both superb, but most intriguing is the magic spell. They say Gallitos hid a powerful spell among the passages of the story, but nobody has ever found it. The whole reason I came to this village was those books, but I haven't yet acquired a single page. There's a rumor that they might be hidden in nearby Cave Town or the Debris of the Muted Site. I paid travelers to search all over the place but still nobody has turned up anything. Now that I've met you, I want to ask you, will you destroy thirty-five Lance Turkavens in the ruins so I can search there myself?	I won't ask anything more than this.

Let's try another approach. Get me thirty slabs of Blue Rat Meat. If my memory serves me right, you can get it by using your Ransacking skill on the Mantle Voltexes. Then take it all to the Merchant Ferr, west of the village. He might give you the book out of mercy.	If you look poor, the wealthy may have pity on you.

It's been pretty quiet for a while since the road between Windrill and Silancium was blocked. Not many outsiders visited here. But then the number of travelers searching for the Archons started rising fast and now there are a number of big and small accidents happening. If this situation continues, the people in the village might not get along with each other any more. One of the travelers told me some small villages have their own festivals, and through these festivals the people of the villages are brought together. I think it's a brilliant idea. We haven't had this kind of festival before, so people are unfamiliar with the idea. I need to promote it and I need some help. It would be best to visit the people in the village one by one... Let's start with Toray. Recently, he tried to search the cave at Cave Town, but he had some trouble because of the Cave Wings. I think he would be very pleased if you hunt them for him. Destroy say... thirty-five of them. Then go to Grave Robber Toray north of the village and earn some credit with him.	Please destroy thirty-five Cave Wings in Cave Town. Then go to Grave Robber Toray north of the village and talk to him about the village festival.	Oh, you're the one who defeated the Cave Wings! I was able to escape thanks to you. The Cave Wings, they're a big headache. How can I repay you? What? A Village festival? Hmm... I've never seen one, but... but I think it will be okay.

Are trying to persuade others to join in? Hmm... Then I'll help you out with some information. Blacksmith Nob recently lost a valuable Portable Anvil and has been very depressed ever since. So if you find it for him, I'm sure he'll join this festival of yours. Where did he say he lost it? Ah.. yes. He said it was in Cavetown. Maybe you can find it among the rocks. If you do, don't forget to bring it to Blacksmith Nob Sandwing east of the village.	This method will work. I guarantee you. Find the Portable Anvil among the rocks at Cave Town. Then give it to Blacksmith Nob east of the village. He'll be so pleased, he'll cooperate.	Isn't that my Portable Anvil? Where did you find it? Oh yes, of course it was there. Memory really is the first thing to go, I guess. Anyway, thank you. How can I repay you? Hmm... a Village festival... Yes, I'll join.

Trancorpse Guilties recently robbed Barios of forty Boxes of Spice. If you get the boxes back, he'll cooperate with the village festival. Take the boxes to Spice Merchant Barios west of the village.	Don't worry, all will be well if you take Merchant Barios the forty Boxes of Spice of the South he lost. Get them from the Trancorpse Guilties in the Muted Site.	Huh? You! Those are my spices! Did you steal them? ... Hmm. I'm sorry if I called you a thief all of a sudden. The mood around here is so tense these days... What? They're having a village festival because of that? Tsk tsk...

What? Two? Well, I can tell you with confidence to give up on Sorcerer Roin. He doesn't think himself as a part of this village. He's always grumbling about living in a Kobold village. So you'd better go to Merchant Ferr. He's very cooperative and wouldn't mind whatever we do, but if he finds out about the festival later, he might feel bad thinking he was left out. Give him a token of our sincerity. Thirty Bandillion's Skins will be more than enough. The skins are from Syllancium, not Windrill, so they're somewhat valuable. You can get them by using your Skinning skills on the Duriven Fallens at the Windrill Eastern Entrance. When you're finished, take them to Merchant Ferr west of the Village.	Take 30 Bandillion's Skins to Merchant Ferr west of the village. You can use your Skinning skills on the Duriven Fallens at the eastern mouth of Windrill. That will work!	Hmm, I don't particularly need Bandillion's Skins. I have tons of them in my warehouse. But I heard there's going to be a village festival and you're promoting it.

He paid the ultimate price for wealth he thought he could get easily. On your way here you may have seen places named the Jewel Land and Cave town. People in Cave own were once miners, but not all the jewels they found in the caves were up to their high standards, so they discarded the inferior stones in the Jewel Land. Legend says the ground there used to be covered with precious gems. My brother went there to find some jewels, but he was too focused on wealth and not on his own personal safety. He was eaten by monsters. He brought this fate on himself, but I still want to hold a service in his memory. So if you destroy forty Adult Hawkarrows in Jewel Land I can search for his remains.

But when Windrill turned into a dessert, it emerged and wreaked havoc on all the inhabitants of Chandra. Eventually, Gracia killed the monster with the legendary weapon Evangarda. When Yaran was alive, it ate a whole lot of travelers whole, so after it died, many treasures were found in its body. But there are several significant objects yet to be found. The most famous one is Chester's Helmet. The helmet belonged to a well-known knight named Chester. It's one of the Moon Elves' things and has a strong resistance to the magic of the Elementals. Recently, a member of the Moon Elf nobility asked me to find it. In order to do that, I'll need to attach the Search Talisman to a tree in Yaran. Can you do that for me? I'll reward you. Oh, and you'll be able to hear me talk to you through the talisman.	You can't just put this anywhere, be careful. Attach this Search Talisman to a tree in Yaaran.

It used to cause so much trouble in Windrill until a Moon Elf named Gracia defeated it. You might have heard the name before? You know, the road to Syllancium used to be blocked, barricaded as a desperate measure to stop Yaaran from escaping to other lands. That was just fifty years ago. The dragon was so huge, Gracia sealed the four legs first and told us to make sure the seals are intact all the time. If the seals are broken, Yaaran may absorb the evil energy into its bones and transform itself into an even stronger monster. We checked the seals regularly, but there's never been a problem, they were still holding well. Recently my servant told me one of the seals was damaged. If that is true, we should repair it immediately. Check the Kataria bound to the tree near the left bridge of Yaaran and if it really has been damaged, bring it back to me as soon as you can.

She took a strange route coming south, and she hid the Archon and didn't share it with other elves. In addition to that, she ruined our underground city for her own purposes. But I heard she destroyed Yaran in Windrill. So I know about the Kataria he used. That's a very valuable object even in the world of us Moon Elves, so It will be difficult to give it to Kobolts.

Usually it's buried under the Ore in the Dragon's Lair in the Closed Mine to prevent the energy from getting out. You might think the ore wouldn't be enough, but believe me, it's the safest way. So go the Dragon's Lair and bring back the Hammer. I'll look forward to your return.	Bring back the Hammer of Judgment hidden under the Ore in Dragon's Lair in the Closed Mine area.	Did you bring it?

I'm from Tabuto Village, the village of the Balcksmiths. About fifty years, all the greatest Blacksmiths in the village worked together to create the best sword on the continent. We named it 'Barracuda' and it was a truly spectacular weapon. Unfortunately, behind our backs one of the Blacksmiths infused the sword with his evil will. As soon as it was finished, the Evil Sword devastated the village, then disappeared. We were never sure where the Sword went, but we think it crossed the lake. Ever since the dark power came from Northernland, rumors of evil have been all around, and we're worried our sword will be involved. We've decided to make a weapon to destroy Barracuda. To succeed, we need Irulda's Hammer. My collegues were bringing it here, but monsters killed all of them and stole the hammer. I'm sure something evil is behind all this, but we have to start somewhere. For the first step, please destroy the Pharaoh Slaves who took the Hammer at the Bullant Hatchery, and retrieve the Hammer! You must help us!	Destroy the Pharaoh Slaves at the Bullant Hatchery, and retrieve Irulda's Hammer!	Thank you.

According to the information collected by my servants, he secretly hid three Bullant's Eggs inside the village. He's intending to bargain with other merchants, but this can't be allowed. First of all, it puts the village in danger. The Bullants react quite violently when their eggs are stolen, and the mother Bullant searches all over, tracing the smell of the egg.

There were lots of valuables in their cargo, so they need to find it no matter what. Wave Dune is a vast region and the dunes shift and change all the time in the wind, so it'll be difficult to find anything in the sand. My colleagues are desperate and I agreed to help them. Of course, the only hope for this task is Clairvoyance Magic. Deribel Sorcerer Excador has a Clairvoyance Spell Book I could use. I sent him a letter and he replied that he's happy to lend me the book, but asked me bring him something he needs for his magic experiments. He asked for thirty-five Eyes of the Sea. You can get them using your Ransacking skill on the Duriven Fallens at the Land of Ufat Land. Deliver them to Sorcerer Excador east of the village.	This is very important for my colleagues, so I'd like you to put in your best efforts.

It's the very place where Nathan and Walcure fought each other, and where Broomhart reappeared. Many people say the desert got its name because it was made within a decade due to the drastic desertification of Windrill. Well, it's very easy to get lost there, as the desert is vast. The region near Meteora is even called the Lost Direction Road, so many people get lost there. So we have put the Gleaming Flag on the rock gate at the entrance of the Desert so Travelers can find their way here even in the dark. While the flag is there, the travelers can keep their bearings and find their way out of the desert, but every time there's a sandstorm, the flag blows away, and the flag we hung a few months ago is gone now. So I'd like to ask you a favor. I'll give you this new Gleaming Flag. Hang it on the rock gate east of the Giant's Highroad. Oh, the communication talisman is attached to the Flag, so you'll be able to listen to my words there.	You will easily find the rock gate once you get there. So hang this Gleaming Flag on the rock gate east of the Giant's Highroad.	I found the rock gate and hung the Flag. When the Flag started moving in the wind, faint light spread through the air along with the quiet bell sound. That's when the headman's voice was heard. Good job! All we can do now is hope the Flag won't be blown off by a stronger wind. Hey, this just occurred to me. I have one last favor to ask you.			3541	Gleaming Flag	1																																			1.

Maybe you'll need to get that pouch and take it to the Headman Yon who is in the North East of the village.	He definitely said it could be found at the stone in the South of Meteora so it should be here somewhere. You have to find the traveller's pouch and go to  the Headman Yon who is in the North East of the village.	Well done.

I think it's a good idea, so I thought we might give it a try, but I need your help. First of all, I'd like to ask you to get thirty slabs of Hawk Meat for food.

3406	An Act of Crime	Evidence One	Hideback; Yon	1		66							<Headman> Yon	<Headman> Yon				We've got a major incident that could lead to a conflict with the safety of the whole village at stake. To solve this problem, I need the help of a traveler like you who can keep a neutral position. Will you help me? Thank you. Let me tell you about the incident. A few days ago, an Orc Nobleman was found dead in the desert. He died from an arrow wound. One of the nobleman's men is furious and shifting the responsibility of finding the murderer onto us. He says if we don't succeed soon, Orcs will devastate this village. What a predicament! Looking at the circumstances, there are three possible suspects. We're working to verify the alibi each one gave us. We can sort out the truth with magic, but we need some evidence to start with. The prime suspect, Emtra, says he was alone hunting Walker Bullants by the Giant's Highroad when the incident happened. The proof he offers is the forty-five Arrows he left in the monsters. We need someone to retrieve all those Arrows. Will you do it? Great!	Destroy Walker Bullants by the Giant's Highroad and retrieve forty-five Arrows.	Good job. I need to analyze the Arrows with magic, so wait a moment.			3549	Extra's Arrow	45	874	Walker Bullant		3549	Extra's Arrow	100	45																												1.

He says he was practicing archery against the trees in the Wave Dune when the incident happened. If you investigate the trees there, you'll be able to find Jacque's Arrows. Bring back all those Arrows.	It might blow away in the sand storm, so let's hurry. Retrieve Jacque's Arrows from the Trees in the Wave Dune.	Good job. I need to analyze these with magic, too.

Most of all, the traveler wouldn't have such terrific archery skills.......  Well, now we are down to the last suspect. This person is under much suspicion because Spice Merchant Barios confirms his alibi. But based on my experience over the years, I can't always believe Barios' testimony. He's easily swayed by his interests, and his eyes show he's concealing something. Let's make him tell the truth by offering him something he can't refuse. Barios wants something called the Giant's Spice. They used to be found in great numbers at the Giant's Highroad, but now they've become rare. I know where one of them is hidden. You'll be able to find the Giant's Spice if you look in the cracks of the rocks south of the Giant's Highroad. Deliver it to Spice Merchant Barios, just west of the village, and ask him about his testimony. Give up if he seems to be giving false testimony just because of the Giant's Spice. What we want from him is truth!	If we put in more effort, we'll get closer to the truth. Find the Spice of Giant in the cracks of the rocks south of the Giant's Highroad and deliver it to Spice Merchant Barios west of the village. Then receive a definite answer about his testimony from him.	The headman must have sent you to hear about the death of the Orc Nobleman. I swear on my ancestors' tomb, I did not tell a lie. He was with me. Oh, isn't that Spice of Giant? Can you sell that to me? You can give it to me if I tell the truth? But...but... Okay, give it to me first. If it is indeed Spice of Giant, I'll think about it. I can't tell if it's genuine from here!																				152371276	3551	Spice of Giant	1																	1.

At first, I thought my memory was exact, but when I thought it over, that's what actually happened. So I didn't intentionally lie. It's just that my memory wasn't exact. Confirm my testimony? Shoot, okay, I will write an oath here that my testimony was false, and that the truth is different from what I first said. Deliver this Oath to Headman Yon northeast of the village. Don't bother me for a bit.	Don't bother me anymore. Deliver this Oath to Headman Yon northeast of the village!	How did it go? Oh, that's what happened. It's good he told us the truth, though belated.

3421	Meteor Crystal	Nob's Request	Hideback; Nob	1		67							<Blacksmith> Nob Sandwing	<Miner> Mine Mystic Eye				Have you been to Meteora? If so, I'm sure you noticed the strange mood there. Long ago a giant meteor hit there. Some say the impact contributed to Windrill turning into a desert. I don't know if that's true, but I know a different legend certainly is. If you dig in Meteora, you can find something called Meteor Crystal. Sorcerers value it more than gold, but it's difficult to collect. The crystal disintegrates if it touches iron or steel, so you can't use a normal shovel. Sorcerer Roin has asked me to make him a special tool for getting Meteor Crystal. Naturally we'll need some unusual materials for this tool. Please go to Mine Mystic Eye at the Old Mine, West of the Verark Basin. He can give you the ore we need. It's called Tetramite.	It may be a long distance, but it should be easy for a competent person like you. Meet Miner Mine Mystic Eye at the Old Mine in Ezerock and bring back the Tetramite River!	Tetramite Ore? If I search my storehouse, I might find some... But I can't give it to you for free.

Now that's true desire! To put it more plainly, if you want the Tetramite Ore, you need to bring me what I want. Not long ago, I received an order from the Trilgard Noble Turgarb. When he received his order, he picked on things that didn't make sense about the items I made, and confiscated all my monthly income. A nobleman doing such a thing! Well, without that money, we'll be living in poverty for a long time. So I want you to go and get the money. No, I'm not asking you to steal it, just take back the money I've been robbed of! If you go south of Trilgard, you'll see Pouches piled up near Noble Turgarb's house. One of the Pouches is our Money Pouch. Bring that back to me!	Hurry, hurry!

Now that I think about it, we haven't dealt with it at all since the incident. What incident am I talking about? The incident when Tetramite Ingots were lost in mass numbers while moving them to the other side of the continent. You might not know about the incident. Oh, right, you can get Tetramite by using this method. Rust Stormers stole the cargo. I don't know if you're aware, but those monsters eat metal. That's the way they supplement their bodies as they're attacked by the sand storms of the desert. So perhaps the Tetramite might be inside their stomachs. If that's not the case, there is no way to get Tetramite for now. We don't have any Tetramite Ore. So there is only one way for you to get the Tetramite. It was West of Orsilian that we were robbed of the Tetramite. Destroy the Rust Stomers there and retrieve thirty-five Tetramites with all that you've got, unless the monsters absorbed all of them into their body.

Humans established it long ago in times of conflict. On the outside, it looks like a place where bandits live, but in fact it's an outpost to observe the Orcs. When Ugdrasil raised his army, he of course didn't leave the place intact. The legend goes that after half a day of battle, all Humans guarding the village died, but the Leader Lan Sand displayed bravery until the very end. So Ugdrasil highly praised his valor and buried Lan Sand's Sword under the earth of Village of the Shadows to protect the land even after his death. Recently, a descendant of Lan Sand asked me to find the sword. I don't like to get involved in this kind of work, but I think the descendant's request is justifiable. So I said yes, but I'm not used to such work. Grave Robber Toray, north of this village, knows much about the relics near the village. Give him a Gorgon Metamorphosis Potion and get information.

It's very difficult to work there. In particular, Bullant Drones are a problem. Makes me shiver just thinking about it. I need your help. While I'm finding the item at the Village of Shadows, I need you to destroy thirty-five Bullant Drones. There's no other way! I'll take the item immediately to Merchant Ferr, west of the village, so you should meet me there when you're done.	Do I need to say it again? Destroy thirty-five Bullant Drones in the Village of the Shadows and go to Merchant Ferr, just west of the village.	Not long ago, Toray gave me the Sword and went away. He said you contributed much.

I've been looking at it while I waited for you. As a merchant, I've handled a lot of weapons, and I can get to know them quite quickly. I'm sure it's proper for the descendants of the Sand Family to want the sword, but I don't think it belongs to anyone anymore. It's been a servant of petty wars for so long, it deserves a respectable rest, so I decided to commit this Sword to the Elementals, giving up the great fortune I could have made by selling it. I need you to help me. If you go South East of the Village you can find one peculiar-looking rock sticking out there. You can commit the Sword to the Elementals through that rock. Please do as I ask!	Offer the Sand Family's Sword on the rock at Giants Highroad. There must be a reply from the Elementals.	I put the Sword on the rock and took a step back. The sword started to glow, then it disappeared. The only thing left was some faint music. I think that was the reply from the Elementals. Looks like the Sand Family's Sword will no longer have to remain in the times of chaos.			3563	Sword of Sand Family	1																																			1.

He's called the Illusion Monster because he's never been seen. In fact, it's wrong to call him a monster at all. Louis never harms anyone, he just plays practical jokes. But a new monster hunter has come to the village and says he's going to destroy Louis. I don't know why, but the hunter seems to believe Louis killed his friends. This is crazy. It was probably the Pharaoh Knights. Louis is good at hiding himself, so this hunt could drag on and on if we don't change the hunter's mind. If you give him his colleagues' rings, the misunderstanding may be resolved. Go destroy the Pharaoh Knights north of the Giant's Highroad and bring back 45 Rings of the Monster Hunters.	If the hunter gets the rings, he'll realize that Louis did not eat his colleagues. Destroy the Pharaoh Knights north of the Giant's Highroad and bring back forty-five Rings of the Monster Hunters.

He just started tracking Louis in earnest. He's an excellent hunter and I heard he's already found Louis' trail. We can't just sit here and let Louis be killed. He lives near Meteora. I think we need to move him to Orsilian. We could lure him using bait. Louis likes Euriale's Talons. Prepare about thirty-five Talons, and lay out them on the rocks west of Orsilian. He'll immediately notice the smell and head that way. Isn't it odd that someone likes Talons? That is why I said Louis is obviously not harmful.	We don't have much time, so let's hurry. Prepare thirty-five Euriale's Talons and put them on the rocks west of Oacillian.	The whole thing sounds highly suspicious, but the headman wouldn't talk nonsense. For the moment, put the Talons on the rocks and we'll watch what happens from the Village.			3329	Euriale's Talon	35																																			1. Get thirty-five Euriale's Talons.	11	2.

If you destroy about forty of them, it will cause a ruckus, which will prompt Louis to move somewhere else. Please help me!	Hurry up.

I'll ask you to carry out a special quest. Talismans of Observation are hung everywhere in the Windrill Desert as many people lose their way. With a Talisman of Observation, we can find out what happened in that area. I think the hunter must be wandering in the Ten Year Desert. A Talisman of Observation is attached to the cactus at the center of the Ten Year Desert. If you touch the Cactus, you can find out what happened in the surrounding area. Go there! Please!	I beg you! Go to the Cactus at the center of the Ten Year Desert, and read what the Talisman of Observation says!	It's the Cactus with the withered Talisman attached to it.

He's in danger, surrounded by Queasa Judges northwest of Village of the Shadows. If you can destroy about fifty of them, I think I can help him escape.

Destroy fifty Queasa Judges North West of the Village of the Shadows to help the hunter escape! Then go to Headman Yon North East of the Village to see if the Hunter escaped safely!	The Hunter arrived a short while ago with wounds all over his body. They're all minor, but he seems to have given up chasing Louis for the moment.

Scrouge came to Terranoa, and was furious because they didn't have the food he wanted. He called it Extreme Muscle Building Food. I saw the name in an old cook book. If I make the food and give it to Scrouge, I could win his favor. It would be good for you, too, if you help me, wouldn't it? Right? So help me with one thing.

He was once a successful merchant and had dreams of creating his own kingdom up there, but even after his capital city was completed, most of the merchants still used Terranoa or this village for trade. He was king of an empty kingdom. Ayorg went bankrupt and crazy, but now he has somehow acquired the skill to control monsters. He has once again dubbed his kingdom the Eternal Empire and is acting like a King. He makes monsters attack passing merchants and steals their cargo. Recently, my own group was plundered and some merchants are being held hostage. Ayorg told me to bring him a ransom if I want to save them, so I need to go negotiate. I have to pass a really dangerous Desert Tribe Village on the way, so I'd like you to escort me. Destroy forty Desert Tribe Members so I can safely pass the Desert Tribe Village.	Help me.

Terranoa is still a small town in many ways, so citizens often get caught up in conflicts with each other. Currently, Safe Keeper Bundle and Nobleman Icigo seem to have gotten into a competition to see who can contribute the most to the budget for maintaining the city. My friend Bundle is just a safe keeper, and Icigo has been running him into the ground, making him look bad for not contributing as much. So I've decided to annoy Icigo to help my friend. Will you help me? Yes, I see you already realize I always do the right thing! What I need is fifty Gargoyle's Skins. With them, I can attract monsters along the road where Icigo's supplies come in. You can get them easily by using your Skinning skills on the Gothicas near Giants Highroad.	If you drag things out, Icigo's supplies will arrive in the city. You have to finish your task before that, so get me fifty Gargoyle's Skins using your Skinning skills on the Gothicas at Lensron.	Good job.

It was nice of you to do her a favor, but please refrain from interfering in our affairs until you get to know the city better. After all, you are just a traveler. I did also hear that you solved Icigo's problems. You cured the wounds he got because you did the wrong thing in the first place. In the future, try to do something right. Do things for the city as a whole instead of just one person. An example? Well, one thing comes to mind. There's a Black Vulture living in the hollow branch of a tree in Wuthering. He comes into the city, picks up anything shiny enough to catch his attention and takes it back to his nest in the tree. Not long ago, he took the city flag. True, it's just some fabric, but also represents the reputation of Terranoa. You could retrieve that flag.	Good things don't always have to be complicated. Find the Flag inside the tree branch at Wuthering.	Fights for power or dominance are not what Terranoa wants to see.

I don't think you're a spy for the captain, so I'll tell you. When the merchants settled in this city, the captain didn't allow any blacksmiths. He was worried their fires would destroy the deck or even the whole ship, which is understandable. I finally persuaded him at least one blacksmith was necessary, or no one would come to the city. He finally agreed to let me in, on the condition that I never harm the ship in any way, and if some accident happens, I have to leave immediately. Well, yesterday my assistant dropped a hot steel bar which scarred the deck. I need to repair it before the captain finds out, but the wood used for this deck is quite rare. I asked Grando to help because she stays on land, but it seems she's having a hard time finding it. So I was looking for someone else to pitch in, and that's when you showed up. Thank you. Go to Supervisor Grando at Mastcot and see how she's getting along.	Help me! Go to Supervisor Grando at Mastcot and see how the plan is going!	Oh, Blacksmith Nym sent you. Well, I haven't found anything yet. The deck was made with wood from the trees growing in this area back when Windrill wasn't a desert. Maybe the blacksmith has no choice but to get kicked out.

As the name implies, Ogres live there, which makes it a very dangerous place. Ogres are feared by everyone because they eat just about every living creature they can fit in their mouths. I was wondering how to erase the village from the map, so I asked my man to spy on them.

I can't tell you the whole story, but I need to get something very precious from Ogre Village. The Ogres don't really care about it. They probably just tossed it aside when they ate the previous owner. But that means it's underground inside the village and there's no easy way to retrieve it. The thing's too heavy and bulky to sneak it out, and nobody can take on the entire village of Ogres. So I propose you lure the Ogres out of the village. We don't have time to come up with a complicated plan, but I hope you can help us. Thirty-five slabs of Wolf Meat will be enough to draw the Ogres out of the Village.

Ogres are on bad terms with the monsters nearby, but they cooperate with Rock Stormers a bit. There's just one reason behind the cooperation. Ogres can't eat Rock Stormers. So, if we attack the Rock Stormers, wouldn't Ogres come help? Although it seems like a foolish plan, we have no other choice. Destroy forty Rock Stormers west of the Land of Loss.	At this point, I'll try anything! It's that precious. Go destroy forty Rock Stormers west of the Land of Loss.	Frankly speaking, I didn't expect much, and indeed it was pointless.

There is one sure way to collect the flower, but it's extremely dangerous because you have to fight Crack Paingains. I don't know why the Crack Paingains swallow the flowers when they bloom, but killing the Paingains and getting the flowers from them is the only reliable way. Of course, I'm no warrior, only a beauty artist. I can't fight monsters. I was going to ask you to do the job. Would that be okay? Thank you.

From what I've heard, you can also take other traveler's items through PK, so if you don't want your items to be taken away by other players, then having them kept in the safe keeper wouldn't be a bad idea?																																								1.

You don't believe me do you? Well then try it out for yourself! I'll tell you what to do. We need some materials for alchemy, but the Lizardmen are preventing us from doing this. Please catch 15 Lizardman soldiers that appear in the Miracle Fountain vicinity. Well, of course by transforming into a deer, you'll understand what I mean!	You turn into a deer when you drink the deer metamorphosis potion! So when you're a deer, kill 15 Lizardman soldiers in the Miracle Fountain vicinity.	How was it? Did you experience the effect?

There are residents that all of the travelers need to meet. I'm going to introduce you to a merchant. Please go and visit Merchant Zion in the center of the village.

Go and visit Merchant Zion in the center of the village	You were sent by the elder! He's always very kind, introducing the new travelers to the merchants. By doing that he's actually following the guidance of the Elements. Life and Mana potions are the things that travelers who battle monsters look for most of the time. Getting these from the monsters has its limits so they tend to buy a lot of potions whenever they come to see us.

Hmm, then I guess you'll have a lot of things that you're not sure about yet. When you start traveling around, you'll occasionally find a 'Reinforcement Potion'. Because this item is so rare, it's traded at a very high price in the auction houses. That potion itself is fairly useless, but a skilled blacksmith like me can use it to improve weapons and armor. Keep that in mind and don't forget to visit the blacksmith when you find a reinforcement potion. Ah, also please keep in mind that one reinforcement potion is consumed per use so think carefully before you decide to use the item.																																								1.

You don't know how dangerous it is outside the gate! I'm starting to ramble on a bit. My job as the Safe Keeper is to keep the valuables safe. We keep travelers' items inside this box. There is a finite amount of space, but it's a good idea to keep the valuable items here.

The chief sent you to us because it is essential that you know us. There are people like the chief wherever you go who represent their village, but they tend to grant more quests than anyone else because they know more of what goes on. So pay attention to the chiefs wherever you go. Now let's stop this chit chat, go and find Elder Brusoto in the central village.	Everyone has their own stories so you can receive quests from many people.

The most basic of that knowledge is knowing the kind of skills that are helpful to you. I'll tell you about them. I'd like to introduce a merchant to you among others the travelers commonly meet. Please go and find Merchant Giridium who is located in the south east of the village. He will tell you the details about what he does.	Merchants can be a travelers best friend. So, learn about them while you have the chance. Visit Merchant Giridium who is located in the south east of the village.	You were sent by the Elder! He's always very kind to introduce new travelers to the Merchants. Life and Mana potions are the things that travelers who hunt monsters need the most. Getting them from the monsters can often result in deficient supplies during the heat of battle, so they tend to buy a lot every time they come and visit us.

Then you still have much to learn. You will occasionally obtain a 'Reinforcement Potion' during the course of your travel. The likelihood of obtaining the Reinforcement Potion is very low so they are often traded at a very price in the auction house. The Potion on its own is completely useless but through a Blacksmith like me, it becomes a very valuable tool to upgrade your weapons and armor. Oh, another thing.

If it wasn't for him, travelers would have to carry all their items all the time. You might have guessed who I'm talking about here, yes the Safe Keeper. You know roughly what he does right? It will be better to talk to him in person to find out what he does in more detail. Go and find Safe Keeper Firnelli in the center of the village.	You'll know when you meet him. Please go and find Safe Keeper Firnelli in the center of the village	A Safe Keeper keeps your deposits safe (as our name would suggest). The size of the depository is limited so you can't keep putting things in there indefinitely. It is a good idea to keep valuable items here. I heard that others can take your items if you are defeated in battle, so if you don't want that to happen, it would be best to leave the items with me in advance.																																								1.

Please go and find Item Trader Ferde in South East of the village.	Some travelers don't really seem to need item traders, but they play an important role in making the continent run more smoothly. Please go and talk to the Item Trader Ferde in southeast of the village.	I haven't seen you before You don't have any items that I can trade do you? You were sent here by the Safe Keeper? Well, if you want to enjoy your travel, it's a good idea to get to know me. Travelers trade items with each other through item traders like myself. There are all sorts of items at various prices. If you're lucky you might be able to get some items at a lower price than the general merchants. You can register an item from your own inventory. You can see the 'Sell' button below on your inventory can't you? So if you place the item in one of the slots that appear when you press 'Sell', the item is automatically registered on our trader's sale list. I'm sure you'll find it's a rather convenient system																																								1.

The Elder sent you to us because it is important to get to know the essential residents like us first. Now, go back to the elder. There are people like the Elder in every village you go to. They are the ones who know most about what goes on in the village, so they tend to grant more quests than anyone else. Pay attention to the chiefs or elders wherever you go. Well, let's stop this chit chat. Go and find Elder Bosren in the north of the village.	Quests are not always granted by the elders. But pay attention to the elders and chiefs as they tend to have the most quests in that village. Go and see Elder Bosren in the North of the village	So you've met all of the merchants? Remember, even though they may not be able to help you in the battlefield, they can be useful allies. Visit the villages or cities regularly and build up a solid relationship with them.

Well, you'll know the difference only when you eat and try hunting for yourself! So please eat the Venison Soup and hunt down 10 Young Vampires from the Path of Glory.

Well, you won't be able to understand the power of Alchemy unless you experience it for yourself. I'll teach you that power. Make 1 Bat Metamorphosis Potion first.

Because you can turn into a monster! If you change into a monster, you'll be able to exhibit stronger power than the actual combat power. You don't believe me? Why don't you try it out for yourself then? Well then, I'll give you a mission. Great, those monsters were really getting on my nerves! Please catch 15 Bandillion Guards that appear in the Lime Lake area. Well, that is by turning into a Deer with the power of the potion of course! Then you'll know what I mean.	If you drink the Deer Metamorphosis Potion, you'll turn into a Deer. So please catch 15 Bandillion Guards that appear in the Lime Lake area.	So, how did you like the increased power?
